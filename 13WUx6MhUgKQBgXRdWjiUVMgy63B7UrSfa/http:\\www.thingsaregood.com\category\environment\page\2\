href="http://www.takeextinctionoffyourplate.com/">Take Extinction Off Your Plate</a> is a campaign to get people not to be vegetarian, just to get people to reduce their meat intake. Producing meat in the modern farming system requires a lot of energy; indeed, <a
href="https://woods.stanford.edu/environmental-venture-projects/consequences-increased-global-meat-consumption-global-environment">Stanford warns about the dangers of global meat production</a>.</p><p>It&#8217;s<a
href="http://www.thingsaregood.com/2008/01/22/5-unusual-reasons-to-be-vegetarian/"> easy to be vegetarian</a>, but remember &#8211; even decreasing your meat consumption can have positive impacts on the world <a
href="http://www.thingsaregood.com/2012/11/06/vegetarians-live-longer/">and your health</a>!</p><blockquote><p>Meat production is one of the main drivers of environmental degradation globally, and the crisis is rapidly growing worse. Production of beef, poultry, pork and other meats tripled between 1980 and 2010 and will likely double again by 2020. This ever-increasing meat consumption in a world of more than 7 billion people is already taking a staggering toll on wildlife, habitat, water resources, air quality and the climate. And Americans eat more meat per capita than almost anyone else. By reducing our meat consumption, we can take extinction off our plates and improve our own health along with the health of the planet.</p></blockquote><p><a

class="entry-content clearfix"><p>During summer heat air conditioners are used extensively and this can increased energy consumption can be crippling. Black outs occur in the summer thanks to people cooling their homes and workplaces &#8211; but these power issues can be avoided. By simply painting roofs white it can help cool buildings and lower energy bills. Painting multiple roofs white can a really positive effect on a large area.</p><blockquote><p>They found that urban expansion alone could increase summer temperatures by up to 6°F in some areas in addition to greenhouse gas-induced warming by 2100. The Mid-Atlantic and Midwest seeing the biggest overall summer temperature increases.</p><p>In all areas, white roofs could completely offset the combined increase in temperatures, and if deployed across the entire megapolitan area, could actually reduce summer temperatures compared to the 1990-2010 average.</p><p>The benefits of cool roofs were particularly prominent for the urban areas stretching from Washington, D.C. to New York, Chicago and Detroit, and California’s Central Valley.</p><p>Cooler summertime temperatures could reduce demand for air conditioning, which could both save money and reduce the chances of electricity grid blackouts.</p></blockquote><p><a

class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Anybody with the ability to reason realizes that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment">anthropogenic climate change</a> is happening &#8211; and it&#8217;s happening in an unpredictable but faster way than previously imagined. The fact that fools argue against this infuriates me as they are essentially arguing against reality.</p><p>Recently, two acclaimed scientific bodies (The Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences) concluded that <a
href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-top-scientists-take-action-now-on-climate-change-2014-2">human caused climate change is occurring</a>. This adds to a chorus of institutions that have reached the same conclusion years ago.</p><p>So what is possibly good about anthropogenic climate change? I have no idea if there is anything positive about it or not. What I do know, is that finally people are calling out the bullshit that the deniers are spouting &#8211; and that is a good thing!</p><p>The less we listen to people who deny the evidence and knowledge of multiple experts in multiple fields the better.</p><p>Indeed, this post was inspired by<a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1z1hyo/two_of_the_worlds_most_prestigious_science/cfpy15c"> a comment made on Reddit</a>. Here&#8217;s just a snippet of the excellent message meant for climate change deniers:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s extremely predictable. Ten years ago, you were telling us that the climate wasn&#8217;t changing. Five years ago, you were telling us that climate change wasn&#8217;t anthropogenic in origin. Now, you&#8217;re telling us that anthropogenic climate change might be real, but it&#8217;s certainly not a bad thing. I&#8217;m pretty sure that five years from now you&#8217;ll be admitting it&#8217;s a bad thing, but saying that you have no obligation to mitigate the effects.</p><p>You know why you&#8217;re changing your story so often? It&#8217;s because you guys are armchair quarterbacks scientists. You took some science classes in high school twenty years ago and you&#8217;re pretty sure it must be mostly the same now. I mean, chemical reactions follow static laws and stuff, or something, right? Okay, you&#8217;re rusty, but you read a few dozen blog posts each year. Maybe a book or two if you&#8217;re feeling motivated. Certainly, you listen to the radio and that&#8217;s plenty good enough.</p><p>I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s needs to be said: <strong>you&#8217;re full of it.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And this is from the article that caused the comment thread:</p><blockquote><p>The publication explains that measurements that distinguish between the different forms of carbon in the atmosphere provide clear evidence that the increased amount of CO2 comes primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, and discusses why the warming that has occurred along with the increase in CO2 cannot be explained by natural causes such as variations in the Sun’s output.</p><p>Many effects of climate change have already become apparent in the observational record, but the possible extent of future impacts needs to be better understood.</p><p>For example, while average global sea levels have risen about 20 cm since 1901, and are expected to continue to rise, more research is needed to more accurately predict the size of future sea-level rise.</p></blockquote><p><a

class="entry-content clearfix"><p>BuzzFeed, of all places, as a great and simple way that explains why the weather of 2014 has been so extreme. In North America it has been more cold than the new &#8220;normal,&#8221; the UK has been hit hard by flooding, and in the South Pacific there has been above average rainfall. Crazy people think this is evidence that global warming (AKA climate change) isn&#8217;t happening. Those people clearly don&#8217;t live in reality. This awful weather is a result of something that&#8217;s been predicted for quite some time: the loss of power in the jet stream.</p><p>Why is this good news? Well, clearly this anthropogenic climate change isn&#8217;t good &#8211; but helping people understand what is going on and why is good news. Just look at these cute this climate gifs:</p><p><img

There’s actually two parts of the jet stream that matter here &#8211; the Asia-Pacific jet stream (where it leaves Asia over Japan) and the North Atlantic jet stream, which runs up from the Americas in the general direction of Europe. Both have a huge influence over our weather &#8211; but when it’s operating normally, it generally means we get fairly standard winters.</p></blockquote><p><a

I've spent too many years playing FPS on the consoles to justify getting a mouse like this. I like my semi-decent logitech bluetooth mouse/keyboard combo well enough for RPGs.

I'm keeping my eyes on this baby, but why oh why are the thumb buttons arranged front to back instead of top to bottom (MS Sidewinder style)? I may be alone in this, but it just seems more natural for me to flick my thumb up and down than to move it front and back Also, Ben, can you comment on the mouse wheel? Can you flick it left and right? I actually love that feature, made raid healing in WoW a breezeRight now I have an MX Revolution, it's pretty awesome with all the programmable buttons and the dual wheels are fantastic, but it's really not a gaming mouse due to the non replaceable battery (had I known this before buying it I probably wouldn't have ordered it, live and learn) and the mouse tracking stalls some times (although I'm not sure if it's because of the laser, the wireless connection or my dirty old mouse pad )

I'm still using an old Intellimouse Explorer 2.0A that's gotta be like 10 years old now and still works fine. (Just ignore the discoloration from my hand)I like the look of the R.A.T. Looks like something you could get 10 years out of. Might try to find one in the store to see just how adjustable it is.

I'm thinking about it, I have some SteelSeries stuff on the way, and when the R.A.T. comes out we should get a review sample. A good gaming mouse is a good mouse, so it's a wider audience for those sort of reviews than just a gaming audience. As someone pointed out above, spending the money for a good mouse improves your computing across the board. As for this being frail, it's anything but. It feels like a brick in your hand. And yes, it's comfortable, even if it hurts your brain to look at it, see the industrial design, and then put your hand on it and feel only smooth edges.

Up to 5600 DPI with a 1ms response time on a wireless mouse - that's just crazy. Also $130 MSRP. Do they have a less pricey wired variant (Imperator maybe)? I don't mind a cord (especially if it's the good braided style like on the G5), and while I know batteries have gotten better, but I still don't like them or the associated cost. Although... I'm probably not hardcore enough for another mouse upgrade. Gotta save for a new CPU... It's not the same guts but the shell of the Mamba is essentially the DeathAdder, which still has up to 3500 dpi on a 3G optical sensor. It has a $59.99 MSRP.The most recent wired mouse from Razer, which has the same 5600 DPI 3G laser sensor as the Mamba, is the Imperator, which has a $79.99 MSRP.The Mamba is really a wonderful mouse, however. I hesitated before but now that I've got it, I'm very happy with the purchase.quote:Originally posted by Talden:Re: Owning a good mouse != cheat.Yeah because the 7-10% of us that are left-handed have an excellent selection of hi-spec peripherals...Sigh... Razer makes several ambidextrous mice that are quite comfortable. The Razer Copperhead, my previous mouse, can be found new online for ~$40 and it's still a great mouse and there are plenty of other options.

the momentary switch for dpi is genius previous dpi changing mice were frankly impractical to use, switching modes was too hard and sniping opportunity is too fleeting to go through the processes.its nice to see innovation in the mouse market. adjust-ability taken to the extreme, this just looks pretty awesome.

However, this mouse just looks too hilariously awesome for me to discount it completely. I can't wait to see one in person.. the Sidewinder just isn't as comfortable as the G5 it replaced. Then you did not install the Logitech drivers. If you use the standard Windows drivers, you get 3 default settings. If you install the Logitech drivers you can have 5 presets and you can choose the DPI setting for each.

I just got a Razer DeathAdder and I love it. Previously I had an MS Intellimouse 3.0a that last a long, long time that I loved. When it broke I replaced it with a Logitech MX518. That was a great mouse but lasted a disappointing 2 years before the cord started to short out and disconnect all the time. I wasn't even considering a Razer since I always considered them kinda gimmicky. I played with a Mamba in a store, though, and it felt great in my hand. However, I wasn't going to drop $130 on a mouse and I don't really care for wireless mice either. When I saw the DeathAdder was basically a wired Mamba I had to get one. It was only $60 and I payed $50 for my MX518 so it seemed like a good deal. Thankfully I picked up the DeathAdder before the Steam sale and I've been very happy with it the last month and half in L4D, Crysis, Max Payne 2, etc. Very great feel both in the hand and in game. Do sort of miss the dedicated DPI buttons my MX518 had though.-Old_Wolf

Anyone know how many programmable buttons are on this thing? I play MMOs and the more the merrier. I have 2 logitech MX-1000s and for me it is the best mouse ever, but they are on their last legs and you can't get them anymore.

Do not go by the photo. There are videos on youtube showing this thing. When I first saw the photo (actually, on Gizmodo, I think, you can find my comments), I laughed heartily, saying, "No way that's going to work for fingertip gamers". Then I saw the video. Holy crap, this thing is awesome. The complete customizability is what really makes it attractive. Hell, it's perfect for fingertip gamers, claw grip gamers, palm grip gamers, and gamers who sit on their mouse. It's so disturbingly awesome, I almost want two.Problem is the expense... $130 for the wireless version? G-damn.

If you need a higher duty cycle than that, you probably also need a WoW intervention!Echoing the above comments, I would love to see a gaming mouse shoot-out here on Ars.

He *can't* use the mouse with his right hand at this point, it's too awkward. No idea how long that took though.That said, of course it would be simpler if more lefty or ambidextrous mice were available and if all keyboards had a detachable numpad that could switch to the left side...

@MoonSharkHey quit mooning me...If I ever have to help someone with their machine and they're set up right-handed then I just use their mouse right-handed. That's not really the same as the intensity of a action game though.Heck I grew up in the pre-mouse mouse (or maybe proto-mouse) era and didn't have the option of button reassignment so I use my mouse left-handed but with right-handed button assignment (middle-finger left-click, index-finger right-click).An interesting detail, all of the places I've worked (software dev BTW) the percentage of lefties in the IT fields is closer to 33% (50% at one).Is the leftie power-gamer market raised above the population 7-10% because of this bias in the IT industry? Would it be if they had a decent selection of left-handed peripherals to use?

They call it R.A.T. because it's ugly looking, right?This wouldn't be a product for Apple enthusiasts - they believe in form over function. That, and no one games on Macs.

Sounds like quality to me, but without the $150 pricetag. I look for a little more in my peripherals than "Isn't broken", but my systems are used for more than casual browsing or after work gaming. This was my point. A $150 mouse can be both worth it, and not worth it, at the same time, for different people. Perhaps a more feature-full mouse would be completely useless to you, if you're not going to use the features there is no reason to pay for them. On the other hand, maybe you don't know what you're missing?Edit: The above is not (only) snark. Have you had a chance to use a more expensive mouse for an extended period? Have you thought about what, in your day to day usage, would be useful if you had it as a button on your mouse? Maybe it's just me, but if I'm not at least slightly annoyed with the shortcomings of something (hardware/software/whatever), it has consistent been because I'm not using it enough.

I'm pretty sure that it's the other way around, Ben; Saitek was making peripherals like this for *years* before the new Transformers movie... Though I have no doubt that both cases are symptoms of a larger problem in the design industry.

Sounds like quality to me, but without the $150 pricetag. You're confusing high quality production with high quality design; they aren't the same thing.I've got a great Intellimouse that will last me for years, but there are some design decisions that were made that aren't as comfortable for me as they could be. If I cared enough (or had a need, such as photo editing, for example), I'd look into getting a mouse that was more suited to the way I grip and click. As it stands now, I'll settle for what I have since I'm lazy and don't use my mouse in a way that would justify a pricetag over, say, $25.The mouse I use for my job is even lower design-quality than at home, but because of what my job entails, I don't miss any of the features it doesn't have. Well, I sometimes miss being able to hit "back" on webpages without clicking a link on the browser, but not as much as I would if my home mouse didn't have the feature.And I couldn't survive having a mouse without a scroll wheel at home or work. One of the other desks has a mouse like that, and it's like I've suddenly lost a finger, or something.For me, a high-priced, advanced design mouse wouldn't be worth the upgrade, but for many other people, it's worth every penny.^-.-^

Although the mouse itself is just fine the top layer of plastic is kind of scratching off on my G5 so gonna want to replace that soon. This is just the kind of thing I like so may have to wait for this to come out before I go for the G500.To anyone else curious it's $130 for the most expensive model, pretty sure the wired version of that is $80-$99 and there are two more models below that with fewer features.

If I also didn't pick up a Mamba last year I would be very interested in this mouse. The adjustable nature of the mouse does scare me though. I've found that the more something is adjustable the sooner it begins to feel old and loose. I was glad to see that it takes an alan wrench to make those changes though. Should help to keep the whole thing tight. I would love to see an Ars review or a comparison as was mentioned. I know most people scoff at the thought of paying $100+ for a mouse, but since the first time I tried a Razer my eyes were opened. I now have a Razer of some kind on every PC in the house.

Hmm, I've had an MX Revolution for about 3 or 4 years, and this is the first mouse since I got it that's gotten my attention.Now, seeing the comments about the left handed users I guess I was lucky in my misery when I was a kid. My parents placed me in a very conservative Catholic school and, being left handed, the nuns would whack my hand hard with a ruler whenever they noticed me writing with my left hand. End result? Ambidexterity baby; I can use a mouse in either hand with no issues (though I do certain things such as holding a fork with the left hand only).

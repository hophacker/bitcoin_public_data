        up to a degree. Aggressive research is indeed needed. The medications

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">How safe
        are prescription drugs?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In 1998
        an extensive study published in the reputable Journal of the American
        Medical Association (JAMA) showed that 106,000 people die each year in
        American hospitals from medication side effects (4). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Let's look
        at this statistic a different way: 106,000 deaths a year averages out
        to nearly 300 deaths per day, every day. Deaths from all major airline
        crashes in the U.S. average less than 300 annually, but 1 airplane crash
        gets more media attention and governmental scrutiny than the 300 medication-related
        deaths which occurred not only on the same day as the airline crash, but
        also every day before and after for decades.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Why has
        this epidemic of side effects gone unrecognized? Deaths from medication
        reactions rarely look any different from natural deaths. There's no visible
        wreckage to videotape, no crash sites to fascinate and horrify TV viewers.
        As media people say, 'No film, no story'. Media and public relations firms,
        and how they shape the public's awereness, are discussed in more detail
        <a href="../beliefs.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Medication
        deaths often occur quietly in hospitals, emergency rooms and private homes.
        When medication-related deaths occur, it's often unclear at first whether
        the cause was the medication, the illness, or some other factor. In other
        words, to much of the media, there is nothing sexy about side effects.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The reported
        adverse effects of drugs are only the tip of the iceberg. Consider 'Digoxin',
        the best-selling heart drug. According to an article in JAMA, the Food
        and Drug Administration (FDA) receives about 82 reports each year involving
        Digoxin, yet a systematic study of Medicare records reveals 202,211 hospitalizations
        for Digoxin adverse effects in a 7-year period (5). That's more than 28,000
        reactions per year, 82 of which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
        hears about.</font></p>

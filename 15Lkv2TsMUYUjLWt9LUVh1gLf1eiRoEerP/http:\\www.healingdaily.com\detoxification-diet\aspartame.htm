        you have heard that Aspartame is a safe sweetener and people use it to
        loose weight. Unfortunately that information is criminally false and misleading.
        You can find out more about how public relations firms shape and manipulate
        the public's beliefs on the &quot;<a href="../beliefs.htm">Why you believe
        what you believe</a>&quot; page. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Aspartame
        is made of 3 components, 50% phenylalanine, 40% aspartic acid and 10%
        methanol (wood alcohol). In the body methanol breaks down into formaldehyde
        (embalming fluid) and formic acid.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">On the
        European Common Market, Aspartame is banned for all children's products.
        Why is this not the case in Canada and the U.S.? Because Monsanto - which
        owns the NutraSweet Company which manufactures Aspartame - pays off the
        FDA, the American Medical Association, The American Dietetic and Diabetic
        Associations, Congressmen and Senators and virtually anyone who gets in
        the way, and in other countries too. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
        caught them red handed and aired a program where Monsanto was trying to
        bribe Canadian Doctors at Health Canada. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">More on
        the Monsanto company: Monsanto is the world's largest manufacturer of
        poisons, not only of the citizens of the world but also of the environment.
        In 1995, Monsanto ranked 5th among US corporations in the EPA's Toxic
        Release Inventory, having discharged 37 million pounds of toxic chemicals
        into the air, land, <a href="water-filtration-systems.htm">water</a> and
        underground. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Responsible
        for mass poisoning of the world. How Robert B. Shapiro, President and
        CEO of Monsanto and the other members of the board, many of whom call
        themselves &quot;Doctors&quot; can live with themselves, knowing what
        they and the company are responsible for is incomprehensible. The entire
        lot should be prosecuted for mass genocide. Their track record of plain
        lying, falsifying and concealing data, bribery of officials, and the list
        goes on, is truly astonishing. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">To quote
      the Toronto Globe and Mail reporting on the outcome of a three year trial,
      &quot;The evidence of Monsanto's executives at the trial portrayed a corporate
      culture where sales and profits were given a higher priority than the safety
      of products and its workers..... They just didn't care about the health
      and safety of their workers. Instead of trying to make things safer, they
      relied on intimidation and threatened layoffs to keep their employees working&quot;.

        in experimental animals. Changes in the genetic material is associated
        with cancer production in humans. The ability of Aspartame to cause cellular
        mutations has been shown through studies by Shephard, et al. There are
        increases in malignant brain tumors suggested to be associated with aspartame

        file complaints with them. Under a recent Freedom of Information order
        the FDA admitted that aspartame accounted for over 75% of complaints filed.
        They claimed that over 8000 were filed, but they keep changing their bookkeeping
        to keep the numbers low. The fact that 8000 reports were received indicates
        that there must have been over 800,000 people adversely affected at the

        and nearly double as much in some carbonated orange <a href="soda-pop.htm">sodas</a>.
        Persons ingesting 5 liters/day can therefore consume over 400 mg methanol.
        These facts are pertinent:</font></p>

            Methyl alcohol is probably the first component of aspartame released
            within the small intestine, and is rapidly absorbed. Blood and methanol
            concentrations correlate with aspartame intake. &quot;Abuse doses&quot;
            (100 mg/kg or more) ingested by normal subjects significantly elevate
            blood methanol concentrations, remaining detectable for 8 or more
            hours (2).</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&#149;
            Humans are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of methanol than animals
            because several enzymes required for its metabolism have been lost
            during evolution and are not present in humans.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&#149;
            The toxicity of methanol is enhanced by its slow rate of oxidation
            &#151; only 1/7 that of ethyl alcohol &#151; occurring mainly in the
            liver and kidneys. Even though the half life in human volunteers ingesting
            small amounts (1-5 ml) is about 3 hours, complete oxidation to carbon
            dioxide usually requires several days.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&#149;
            The body attempts to detoxify methyl alcohol by oxidizing it to formaldehyde
            (a deadly neurotoxin and Class A carcinogen), and then to formate
            or formic acid within minutes. Formate and formaldehyde each may contribute
            to toxicity and nervous system/immune dysfunction through various
            mechanisms. One is the conjugation of formaldehyde with human serum
            albumin (F-HSA) to form a new antigenic determinant. Patients with
            multiple health complaints who had been exposed chronically to formaldehyde
            develop anti F-HSA antibodies and elevated Tal cells (antigen memory
            cells), consistent with sustained antigenic stimulation of the <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune

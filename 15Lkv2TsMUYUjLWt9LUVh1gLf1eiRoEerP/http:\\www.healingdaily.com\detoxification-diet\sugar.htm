        last 20 years, we have increased sugar consumption in the U.S. 26 pounds
        to 135 lbs. of sugar per person per year! Prior to the turn of this century
        (1887-1890), the average consumption was only 5 lbs. per person per year!

        index&quot; is a measure of how a given food affects blood-glucose levels,
        with each food being assigned a numbered rating. The lower the rating,
        the slower the absorption and <a href="enzymes.htm">digestion process</a>,
        which provides a more gradual, healthier infusion of sugars into the bloodstream.
        On the other hand, a high rating means that blood-glucose levels are increased
        quickly, which stimulates the pancreas to secrete <a href="insulin.htm">insulin</a>
        to drop blood-sugar levels. These rapid fluctuations of blood-sugar levels
        are not healthy because of the stress they place on the body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One of
        sugar's major drawbacks is that it <a href="insulin.htm">raises the insulin
        level</a>, which inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn
        depresses the <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune system</a>.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">An influx
        of sugar into the bloodstream upsets the body's blood-sugar balance, triggering
        the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood-sugar at a constant
        and safe level. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat, so that when
        you eat sweets high in sugar, you're making way for rapid weight gain
        and <a href="../conditions/triglycerides.htm">elevated triglyceride levels</a>,
        both of which have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Complex carbohydrates

        for one another upon entering the cells. And the thing that mediates the
        entry of glucose into the cells is the same thing that mediates the entry
        of vitamin C into the cells. If there is more glucose around, there is
        going to be less vitamin C allowed into the cell. It doesn't take much:
        a blood sugar value of 120 reduces the phagocytic index by 75%. So when

        refined dietary sugars lack minerals and vitamins, they must draw upon
        the body's micro-nutrient stores in order to be metabolized into the system.
        When these storehouses are depleted, metabolization of cholesterol and
        <a href="healing-fats.htm">fatty acid</a> is impeded, contributing to

            that the honey bear is the only animal found in nature with a problem
            with tooth-decay (honey decays teeth faster than table sugar). Honey
            has the highest calorie content of all sugars with 65 calories/tablespoon,
            compared to the 48 calories/tablespoon found in table sugar. The increased

        it in order to give it a clear appearance to enhance sales. If you are
        going to consume honey, make sure it is raw, unheated honey. Good to use
        in special cures, but not as an every day food. It is not much better

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Sugar
        and cancer</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Of the
        over 4 million <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>
        patients being treated in the U.S. today, almost none are offered any
        scientifically guided nutrition therapy other than being told to "just
        eat good foods." Many cancer patients would have a major improvement in
        their conditions if they controlled the supply of cancer's preferred fuel:
        GLUCOSE. By slowing the cancer's growth, patients make it possible for
        their <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune systems</a> to catch
        up to the disease. Controlling one's blood-glucose levels through <a href="../detoxification-diet.htm">diet</a>,
        <a href="../mini-trampoline-exercise.htm">exercise</a>, supplements, <a href="../exercise/transcendental-meditation-1.htm" target="_blank">meditation</a>
        and <a href="../conditions/pharmaceutical-companies.htm">prescription
        drugs</a> - when necessary - can be one of the most crucial components
        to a cancer treatment program. The saying &quot;Sugar feeds <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>&quot;
        is simple. The explanation is a little more involved. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">German
        Otto Warburg, Ph.D., the 1931 Nobel laureate in medicine, first discovered
        that cancer cells have a fundamentally different energy metabolism compared
        to healthy cells. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The gist
        of his Nobel thesis was this: malignant tumors frequently exhibit an increase
        in &quot;anaerobic glycolysis&quot; - a process whereby glucose is used
        by cancer cells as a fuel with lactic acid as an anaerobic by-product
        - compared to normal tissues.(1)</font></p>

        <tr>
          <td height="1" width="373">
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">
              The large amount of lactic acid produced by this fermentation of
              glucose from the cancer cells is then transported to the liver.
              This conversion of glucose to lactate creates a lower, <a href="../conditions/saliva-ph-test.htm">more
              acidic PH in cancerous tissues</a> as well as overall physical fatigue
              from lactic acid build-up.(2,3) Therefore, larger tumors tend to
              exhibit a <a href="../conditions/saliva-ph-test.htm">more acidic
              PH</a>.(4)</font></p>

        supplements, <a href="../mini-trampoline-exercise.htm">exercise</a>, medication
        when necessary, gradual weight loss and stress reduction. Since cancer
        cells derive most of their energy from anaerobic glycolysis, the goal
        is not to eliminate sugars or carbohydrates entirely from the diet but
        rather to control blood-glucose within a narrow range to help starve the
        cancer cells and boost <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune function</a>.</font>

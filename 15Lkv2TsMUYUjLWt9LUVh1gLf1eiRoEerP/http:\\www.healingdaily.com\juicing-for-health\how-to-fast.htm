        of most nutritional supplements can also be stopped the day before fasting.
        Supplements are usually not recommended during a fast. Many people do
        well by preparing for their fasts with 3 or 4 days of consuming only fruits
        and vegetables. These foods nourish and slowly detoxify the body so that
        the actual fasting will be less intense. </font></p>

        1-day fast (actually 36 hours, including the nights - from 8 p.m. one
        night until 8 a.m. the following day) gives us a chance to see what a
        short fast can be like, to see that this is not so difficult and doesn't
        cause any major distress. </font></p>

          symptoms - such as a headache or irritability - by the end of the day,
          but this depends on the person and their state of toxicity. Usually,
          the first 2 days of fasting are the hardest for most people. Feeling
          great usually begins around day 3, therefore longer juice fasts are
          really needed for the grand experience. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One of
        the problems with fasting is that it can be the most difficult for those
        who need it the most, such as the regular 3-square-meals-plus-snacks/day
        consumers who eat whenever and whatever they want. Often these people
        must start with more subtle diet changes and prepare even more slowly
        for fasting. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A transition
        plan which can be used before even going on the 1-day fast is the 1-meal-a-day
        plan. The one daily meal is usually eaten around mid-afternoon. Water,
        fresh fruit or vegetable juices, and teas can be eaten at other times.
        The one wholesome meal is not rich or excessive. It can be a protein-vegetable
        meal, such as fish and salad/steamed vegetables, or a starch-vegetable
        meal, such as brown rice with mixed steamed greens, celery, carrots, and
        zucchini. People on this plan start to detoxify slowly, lose a bit of
        weight, and after a few days feel pretty sound. The chance of any strong
        detoxification symptoms developing, as might occur with fasting, is minimal
        with this type of transition, and the actual fast, once begun, will be
        handled more easily, too. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The goal
      then, is to move into a 1-day fast and then a few 2- and 3-day fasts with
      1 or 2 days between them when light foods and more <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">raw
      vegetables and fruits</a> are consumed, and also provide fluids, soups,
      juices, and a generally <a href="../conditions/saliva-ph-test.htm">alkaline</a>
      cleansing diet. This way, we can build up to a 5 to 10-day fast.</font></p>

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Juice
        fasting provides nutrients to your body</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Again I
        do not recommend a water fast. A juice fast is much easier for most people.
        The fresh juices of raw vegetables and fruits are what most fasting clinics
        and practitioners recommend. The juices provide calories and nutrients
        on which to function and build new cells, and also provide important enzymes
        contained in these vital foods. (Food enzyme theories are discussed at
        length in Dr. Edward Howell's book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0895292211/healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">Enzyme
        Nutrition</a>&quot;) <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">Raw
        foods</a> are considered the healing force in our diet because they contain
        active enzymes, which are broken down once foods are cooked. Many consider
        a raw-food diet the most healing and most nutritious diet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For the
        begining faster, it is best to go slowly through the various steps and
        to avoid being impatient or excessive so that we learn about ourselves
        in the process. To do this, we need to make a plan and put it into effect,
        observing or listening to our body and even keeping notes in a journal.
        Get to really know yourself. Then, once we have fasted successfully, we
        could continue to do 1-day fasts every week or a 3-day fast monthly if
        we need them.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Fasting
        clinics often suggest that enemas be used daily to help cleanse the colon,
        while fasting. With these, usually <a href="../detoxification-diet/water-filtration-systems.htm">filtered
        water</a> alone is used to flush the colon of toxins. Instructions on
        how to do an enema can be found <a href="../liver-detoxification/coffee-enema.htm">here</a>.
        Although when fasting, replace the coffee with filtered water only.</font></p>

      The &quot;saltwater flush&quot; is useful for those who can tolerate it.
      A solution of 2 teaspoons of <a href="http://coldfusion.affiliateshop.com/AIDLink.cfm?AID=098230&Redirect=/search/search.php?keywords=sea+salt" target="_blank" >unrefined
      sea salt</a>
      is dissolved in a quart of warm <a href="../detoxification-diet/water-filtration-systems.htm">filtered
      water</a> (not distilled) and is drunk first thing in the morning on every
      other day throughout the fast to flush the entire intestinal tract. Whatever
      colon cleansing method is used, keep in mind that regular cleansing of the
      colon and intestines is a key component of healthy and stress-free fasting.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The amount
        of vegetable and fruit juice you drink will determine the intensity of
        the cleansing. Drinking small amounts of juice supplies fewer calories,
        which increases the intensity of detoxification. The more intense the
        cleansing, the greater the discomfort. Juice fasting allows you to have
        control over the process of elimination. However, when the body enters
        a cleansing crisis due to toxins in the blood, no amount of juice will
        eliminate the discomfort. You must wait it out.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Breaking
        the fast</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It is important
        to make a gradual transition back into our regular diet, rather than just
        going out to dinner after a week-long fast. Breaking a fast must be planned
        and done carefully and slowly to prevent creating symptoms and sickness.
        It is suggested that we take a few days to move back into our diet, which
        is hopefully a new, more healthful diet. Our <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">digestive
        system</a> has been at rest, so we need to go slowly and chew our foods
        very well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">With juice
        fasting, it is easier to make the transition back into foods. A raw or
        cooked low-starch vegetable, such as spinach or other greens, can be used.
        A laxative-type meal, such as <a href="../detoxification-diet/grapes.htm">grapes</a>,
        or soaked or stewed prunes, or cherries, can also be used to initiate
        eating, as it is important to keep the bowels moving. Some experts say
        that the bowels should move within 2 to 3 hours after the first meal.
        If not, take an enema. Some people may want to do a saltwater flush (drinking
        a quart of water with 2 teaspoons of <a href="http://coldfusion.affiliateshop.com/AIDLink.cfm?AID=098230&Redirect=/search/search.php?keywords=sea+salt" target="_blank" >unrefined
        sea salt</a>
        dissolved in it) before their first day of food. </font></p>

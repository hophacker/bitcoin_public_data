      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">An important
        characteristic of the Hubbard detoxification program is the use of niacin.
        Niacin has the well-known effect of causing "vasodilation", often called
        the niacin flush, which is an opening of the small blood vessels, the
        capillaries, so that more blood flows through them. These are the blood
        vessels which are of most value in reaching fatty tissues. In this way
        the toxins which are stored in these fatty tissues can be removed, into
        the bloodstream, and processed out of the body. However, niacin is also
        made in the form of niacinamide - a form of vitamin B3 which, deliberately,
        is manufactured so that it will NOT cause dilation of the blood vessels
        - the flush so well known when using plain niacin. A detoxification program
        which features the use of niacinamide and also claims to improve blood
        circulation would be based on false science. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Some detoxification
        programs don't even recognize that the toxins they claim to be removing
        are stored in fatty tissues. The idea of removing these toxins by some
        procedure which does not include niacin is not practical.</font></p>

            causing small blood vessels in your body to be expanded in size. Many
            of your small blood vessels, called "capilaries" are so small that
            blood cells can only go through them in single file. Sometimes, in
            fact, that small capilary passageway is clogged and blood doesn't
            get through at all.</font></td>

        small capillaries. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The niacin
        causes these small capilaries to expand - so they might be able to carry

        blood close to the surface of the body. As the blood flows in these areas,
        the cells of the small capilaries will also be getting rid of their waste
        products, and often they produce 'histamine' as part of this process.
        That histamine is another natural substance produced by every cell in
        the body when a cell is under attack, or is eliminating toxins. Histamine
        causes an 'itchy' feeling.</font></p>

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Cardiovascular
        benefits of niacin</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The cardiovascular
        benefits of niacin have been studied in several major clinical trials
        (1-5). The primary cardiovascular measures such as cholesterol and <a href="../conditions/triglycerides.htm">triglyceride
        levels</a>, <a href="../conditions/stroke-prevention.htm">strokes</a>
        and <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart attacks</a> are all
        significantly reduced with niacin therapy (sometimes used alone and sometimes
        used along with other <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">drug therapy</a>).
        Overall, the use of niacin (nicotinic acid, but not the other form called
        &quot;niacinamide&quot;) to treat or prevent high levels of blood cholesterol
        and triglycerides and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease is well
        substantiated. In a large number of clinical trials, niacin has been shown
        to consistently lower total and LDL (�bad�) cholesterol - by about 20%
        - and triglycerides - by 10 to 25%, while increasing levels of HDL (�good�)
        cholesterol - by 15 to 25%.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
        </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Niacin
        safety</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">There are
        several precautions which one needs to implement however when one uses
        niacin. Niacin usually has a &quot;flush effect&quot; - which is not harmful
        - associated with it which is very similar to the hot flashes women experience
        during menopause. Niacin supplements are available in regular and �timed-release�
        forms. Timed-release versions of niacin have been made available to avoid
        this &quot;flush&quot; effect. The problem with most TIMED-RELEASED niacin
        is that they are associated with a high degree of liver problems. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> The timed-release
        forms of nicotinic acid are intended for a prolonged release of niacin
        during its 6-8 hour transit time in the intestines, but timed-release
        niacin is also associated with greater toxicity and safe doses are only
        about half of normal-release forms of niacin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In the
        high doses used for controlling cholesterol levels (anything above 100mg/day),
        nicotinic acid can cause skin flushing and skin itching as well as headaches,
        lightheadedness and low blood pressure. The niacinamide form of niacin
        does not cause these side effects, but it is not effective in reducing
        cholesterol levels, so it is seldom taken in such high doses. The slow-release
        versions of niacin supplements have the potential for causing liver damage
        (even at �lower� doses of 500mg/day) - so blood tests to monitor for liver
        damage are recommended and high-dose niacin supplementation should only
        be undertaken under the guidance of a natural physician.</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Anyone
        with liver disease, including those who consume more than 2 drinks of
        alcohol daily, should not take high-dose niacin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Niacin
        is cheap, so its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol levels may be an
        inexpensive solution to reducing a known risk factor for <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">cardiovascular
        disease</a>. When monitored properly by a natural physician, niacin therapy
        can be almost as effective as the popular (and expensive) <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">statin
        drugs</a> for lowering cholesterol and <a href="../conditions/triglycerides.htm">triglyceride
        levels</a>. Niacin may be the most cost-effective lipid-lowering agent
        currently available. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In my opinion,
        the best price on the internet for high quality niacin can be found <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.24595&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">here</a><img alt="icon" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&bids=20052.70105372&type=10&subid=">.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Niacin
        dosing is usually started at the low-end (100mg/day), with increasing
        doses of 250mg each week until blood lipid levels start to normalize (or
        side effects develop). Side effects are usually minimized by increasing
        the dosage slowly to the common therapeutic range of 1000-1500mg/day.
        Niacin doses should be divided into 2-3 separate daily doses, or no more
        than 500-750mg per individual dose).</font></p>

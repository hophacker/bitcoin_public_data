      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Cancer
        And Oxygen</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Cancer
        cells cannot survive in the presence of <a href="cancer-and-oxygen.htm">high
        levels of oxygen</a>. To understand why some tissues in the body are deficient
        in oxygen and therefore prone to cancer, it is helpful to understand the
        nature of <a href="saliva-ph-test.htm">acidity and alkalinity in the body</a>.
        Cancerous tissues are acidic, whereas healthy tissues are alkaline. <a href="../detoxification-diet/water-filtration-systems.htm">Water</a>
        (H2O) decomposes into H+ and OH-. When a solution contains more H+ than
        OH- then it is said to be acidic. When it contains more OH- than H+ then
        it is said to be alkaline.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">When oxygen
        enters an acid solution it can combine with H+ ions to form water. Oxygen
        helps to neutralize the acid, while at the same time the acid prevents
        oxygen from reaching the tissues that need it. <a href="saliva-ph-test.htm">Acidic
        tissues</a> are devoid of free oxygen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">An alkaline
        solution is just the reverse. Two hydroxyl ions (OH-) can combine to produce
        one water molecule and one oxygen atom. In other words, an alkaline solution
        can provide oxygen to the tissues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The pH
        scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Below 7 is acid and above
        7 is alkaline. The blood, lymph and cerebral spinal fluid in the human
        body are designed to be slightly alkaline at a pH of 7.4.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Body PH
        is a very important topic and is discussed in detail <a href="saliva-ph-test.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Dr. Szent-Gyorgy
        won the nobel prize in 1937 for discovering that <a href="../detoxification-diet/healing-fats.htm">essential
        fatty acids</a> combined with sulphur-rich proteins (such as those found
        in diary products) increases oxygenation of the body. Dr. Budwig applied
        this discovery in clinical trials by feeding cancer patients a mixture
        of 3-6 Tbsps. <a href="../detoxification-diet/flaxseed.htm">flaxseed oil</a>
        and 4 oz. (1/2 cup) low-fat cottage cheese daily. The mixture is most
        effective if the flaxseed oil and low-fat cottage are thoroughly mixed
        or blended. You can add pineapple or other fruit to improve the taste.
        After about three months improvements could be seen in the blood of the
        cancer patients, and the malignant tumors began to shrink. More about
        the role of oxygen in fighting cancer can be found <a href="cancer-and-oxygen.htm">here</a>.
        My favorite oxygen product can be found <a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-1236392-10273898?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kalyx.com%2Fstore%2Fproddetail.cfm%3FItemID%3D7530.0%26CategoryID%3D8000.0%26SubCatID%3D2240.0" target="_blank" >

        slightly above 7.4 cancer cells become dormant and at pH 8.5 cancer cells
        will die while healthy cells will live. This phenomenon has given rise
        to a variety of treatments based on increasing the alkalinity of the tissues,
        treatments such as vegetarian diet, the <a href="../juicing-for-health.htm">drinking
        of fresh fruit and vegetable juices</a>, and dietary supplementation with

        A free radical is an ion that has a positive electrical charge. An electron
        has a negative electrical charge. Due to its positive charge, the free
        radical attracts electrons from other molecules, thereby damaging them.

        many prescription drugs, processed foods, cigarette smoke, environmental
        pollution, alcohol, electromagnetic radiation, and stress. Many of those
        sources of free radicals are under your control, because they result from
        lifestyle choices which in many cases you have control over.</font></p>

      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Enzymes
        to Dissolve Cancers</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Dissolving
        cancerous tissue requires enzymes. Dietary supplements containing the
        ten or more pancreatic enzymes are helpful, with the most important enzymes
        being trypsin and chymotrypsin. These enzymes dissolve the protein coat
        of the cancer cell making it vulnerable to the attack of white blood cells.
        Diets which are high in protein and refined foods such as <a href="../detoxification-diet/sugar.htm">white
        sugar</a> and white flour deplete pancreatic enzymes, and thus help to
        open the way for cancer because the pancreatic enzymes are not available
        to dissolve the protein coat of cancer cells which may be present in the
        body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Pineapple
        and papaya are good sources of enzymes. You have the papaya melons as
        the source of the enzyme Papain and pineapple as a source of the enzyme
        Bromelain. The demasking effect of these enzymes against the pericellular
        layer of the malignant cell is something very concrete in the immunology
        of cancer. Once the enzymes have dissolved the protein coating of the
        cancer cells, the white blood cells are able to recognize them as foreign
        cells. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Dietary
        sources of all kinds of enzymes are useful. The consumption of at least
        70% fresh foods vs. 30% cooked foods helps ensure a supply of enzymes
        for the body (cooking at temperatures above 120&ordm; F destroys enzymes
        in the food). Raw, fresh foods generally contain <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">all
        the enzymes required</a> for their own digestion, easing the burden on

      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Vitamin
        B17 to Fight Cancer</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> The Hunza
        people eat a lot of apricots and always crack open the kernel and eat
        the seed. The apricot seed contains <a href="../detoxification-diet/vitamin-b-17-laetrile.htm">Vitamin
        B17, also known as laetrile</a>. Vitamin B17 is purported to be the anti-cancer
        vitamin. Some researchers have found that cancer and sickle cell anemia
        are caused by a deficiency of vitamin B17, just as scurvy is caused by
        a deficiency of <a href="../detoxification-diet/vitamin-c.htm">vitamin
        C</a>, pernicious anemia is due to a deficiency of vitamin B12 and <a href="../detoxification-diet/folic-acid.htm">folic
        acid</a>, and pellagra is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3. Vitamin
        B17 kills cancer cells without harming normal cells, making it nature's
        chemotherapy. If vitamin B17 was patentable cancer would not be the problem
        it is today. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">First discovered
        in 1830, this vitamin has never been recognized by the Food and Drug Administration
        (FDA) and therefore it is not in any of the popular vitamin tablets. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Foods rich
        in vitamin B17 include: </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><a href="http://coldfusion.affiliateshop.com/AIDLink.cfm?AID=098230&Redirect=/search/search.php?keywords=barley&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" >
        Barley</a>,
        bitter almonds (not the sweet almonds commonly available), native (bitter)
        cassava, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), grass (wheat grass and many other
        grasses), lentils, <a href="../detoxification-diet/flaxseed.htm">flaxseed</a>,
        millet, and the seeds of various fruits (apple, apricot, blackthorn, cherry,
        nectarine, peach, plum). Most of these foods have been deleted from the
        modern diet. To prevent cancer, a maintenance dose of vitamin B17 can
        be provided by eating several bitter almonds or apricot seeds daily. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The difference
        between sweet almonds and bitter almonds is the vitamin B17 that the bitter
        almonds contain. If you are using the 500 mg tablets of vitamin B17, the
        beneficial effects will be magnified if you eat 5 - 7 sweet almonds along
        with the tablets because the enzymes in the almonds complement the vitamin.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">However,
        vitamin B17 cannot function without sufficient zinc in the body. Also,
        better results are achieved if the vitamin B17 is taken together with
        other nutrients such as <a href="../detoxification-diet/vitamin-c.htm">vitamin
        C</a>, the other B vitamins, vitamin A, manganese, magnesium, and selenium.
        Doctors prescribing vitamin B17 will generally use it as part of a total
        nutritional program consisting of diet, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and
        <a href="../detoxification-diet/healing-fats.htm">essential fatty acids</a>.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The full
        story of vitamin B17 is to be found in the book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0912986190/healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">World
        Without Cancer</a>&quot; by G. Edward Griffin, American Media, 1997. This
        popular book is in its 13th printing and I highly recommend it. Griffin
        also made a video tape entitled &quot;World Without Cancer&quot; summarizing
        the contents of the book. Alternative names for vitamin B17 are nitrilosides,
        amygdalin and laetrile. Regardless of what you have read in newspapers
        about <a href="../detoxification-diet/vitamin-b-17-laetrile.htm">laetrile</a>,
        withhold your judgment until you have read the book and watched the video.
        Vitamin B17 is a standard part of alternative cancer therapy world-wide.</font></p>

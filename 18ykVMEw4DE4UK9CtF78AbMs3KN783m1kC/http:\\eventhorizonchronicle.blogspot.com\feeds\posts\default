It first began in the 1950s in Tidewater Virginia, in the fields, orchards, woods, creeks, swamps and salt marshes in the lower Chesapeake Bay region. My brothers and I spent a lot of time playing in the woods and wetlands that were all around our family home. We frolicked in the shallow waters of the Warwick River, across from Mulberry Island, wearing tennis shoes to keep from slicing our feet on the oysters that were plentiful in those years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The skipjacks still came right in near the shore in those days, so their crews could tong the oysters in the coastal shallows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;That wasn&#39;t too far from Oyster Point. The men&#39;s voices rang out across the water, bantering and joking as they worked. But I don&#39;t think that happens anymore. The last time I was back I saw that the skipjacks, the oysters and the men who tonged them, the fields and pastures, peach and apple orchards, woods, creeks, and a good many of the little swamps and marshes are gone, all effaced by time and the relentless march of so-called &quot;progress&quot; - - in other words the relentless march of bulldozers, chain saws, parking lots, boat marinas, strip malls, fast food joints, multiplex cinemas, and endless miles of cracker box, residential suburbs of stapled together, look-alike, middle class and lower middle class breeding hutches rented out by the decade on easy to afford, completely non-payable mortgages guaranteed to bankrupt the randy suckers who eagerly signed their lives, fortunes and prosperity away on the guttering bottom line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enter The Bone Lady&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Be all that as it may, on a fresh spring day in 1958 my mother had put me and my older brother out on the screened, sun porch to play. The day and the events of that day are indelibly stamped on my memory as if forcibly impressed upon my brain with the ineluctable &lt;a href=&quot;http://preview.audioblocks.com/sfx/mp3preview/MECH_105.mp3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clunkity-chunk&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;akashic&lt;/a&gt; archivist&#39;s mechanical stamper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I was a sickly child in those days and at the time it was not altogether clear if I would live or die. One of the few foods that my system could tolerate was Cheerios, which I ate with relish, but only with a crochet hook, and only one at a time, the preferred method being to skewer the Cheerios individually, by poking the crochet hook through the hole in the middle. The hook kept the Cheerios from getting away, so once they were hooked you could reliably raise them to your mouth and eat them. My mother had thoughtfully supplied me with a bowl of Cheerios and a crochet hook to keep me occupied. My brother was playing with some little toys and I was sitting on the porch floor directly in front of him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I somehow managed to tip the bowl of Cheerios over and they went rolling all over the place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Botheration! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The logical thing to do would have been to simply scoop them up with my hands, but that would have entirely defeated the purpose of the crochet hook, so I dutifully set to work hooking the AWOL Cheerios, one by one, and returning them to the bowl. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I was engrossed in that task when my attention was suddenly drawn upwards, to the eaves of the house, and one of the most compelling personages or entities that I have ever encountered anytime, anywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;There, peering over the eaves at me, was &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;/i&gt;. I will never forget her. Tall, gaunt, bone-like, with a hypnotic, penetrating gaze that struck me to the core of my soul. I was only three years old but I knew right away that I was witness to a rare and compelling encounter. I looked over at my brother and tried to get him to look up to the eaves at &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;/i&gt;, but he was riveted to the floor, rooted where he sat, immobile, as if in a trance. He would not move or say anything. He was totally unresponsive. He was oblivious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The visit was evidently meant only for me, and, oh, what a visit it was. &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;/i&gt; gazed deeply into me and I gazed deeply back. Information, feelings, information and visions cascaded into and through me. It was over in a couple of minutes, but when she went away, she did not leave me with nothing, because she had given me to understand that in the coming decades everything would change, that terrible times of great confusion and darkness, of deep trouble and turmoil, of death and destruction were on the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;If you look around the world, you can objectively see that that is the case. Chernobyl, Fukushima, GMO food, nanothechnology, rampant chemical contamination of the environment, global ecological unraveling, habitat destruction, chemtrails, deforestation, regional wars here and there, overfishing, biological warfare (AIDS, Ebola, etc.) the exploitive, poverty producing, fiat-currency-based, central-bank-warfare model of economics, the ever-present threat of nuclear war, ever expanding surveillance, monitoring and social control of the global population, and much more, have demonstrated to my complete satisfaction that everything that &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;downloaded to me in 1958 is either true, coming true, or is potentially about to come true, and in spades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;At the same time, while &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;/i&gt; imparted that heavy message to me, she also left another, important, enduring, soul-level imprint on my consciousness. To wit: though all of this was so to speak, pre-baked into the cake, presumably for powerful karmic interests and galactic political reasons, that there is also a powerfully divine reality of tremendous peace, harmony, wisdom, joy and unimaginable consciousness and knowledge, not to say Cosmic Love of the Creator for the creation and the innumerable, created, conscious beings that populate the immensity of &lt;b&gt;All That Is&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Well, those were an awfully big, cosmically insightful few minutes for such a sickly, little boy. But it was just about then that I began to get better and my parents and the doctors realized that I was probably going to survive my infancy. My mother said that she could tell something unusual had happened to me because I kept wandering around in the front yard, looking and pointing at the roof of the house and talking about &lt;i&gt;The Bone Lady&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;So it was that ever since 1958 I have had a very basic understanding of how things work: that there is terrible, unimaginable evil at work in this world and it consciously plots, schemes, plans, conspires and seriously &lt;u&gt;intends&lt;/u&gt; to cause mayhem, death, destruction, oppression and suffering. Look around and you readily see this diabolical force at work on our planet. In terms of geopolitical centers of power where this force resides, places like Israel, Manhattan, NYC, Washington, DC, the City of London and Vatican City are some of the primary hell holes where this demoniac force is headquartered, though it also projects from numerous other locales around the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I also understood that it is within the realm of possibility to transcend all of that planet-destroying, human-race-destroying darkness. That is because the creation ultimately stems from the Creator and if the Creator&#39;s creation desires to throw in with the Creator, to go all in, as it were, to consciously synchronize with the universal, creative harmonic of &lt;b&gt;All That Is&lt;/b&gt;, then &lt;u&gt;nothing&lt;/u&gt; can stand against that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The issue today is that the great masses of humanity have not done that. If anything, a large percentage have elected to move in a contrary direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The planet is reeling as a consequence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nuclear Threat of Global Extinction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I well remember as a young child&amp;nbsp; the worried conversations of my parents over the Cuban Missile Crisis. I knew it was bad. I was just a small boy, but I understood that the fate of the world hung in the balance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The &quot;duck and cover&quot; drills we did in elementary school in the 1960s also drove the point home. The idea was that if we students would go out into the central hallway of the school building, kneel on the floor in long rows and put our hands over our little heads, that that would protect us from city-busting, Commie H-bombs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2543&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explosion of a USSA Air Force Titan II ICBM in its silo&lt;/a&gt;, not far from Damascus, Arkansas really got my attention. The year was 1980 and I was working as a miner in Morton Salt&#39;s Weeks Island mine, down on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. I was twenty-five years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Not long after the missile exploded in its silo, I ended up driving to north-central Arkansas and going over the security fence onto another, nearby Titan II missile silo in a nonviolent, peace demonstration. I was arrested and jailed in Jacksonville, Arkansas, just north of Little Rock. I lost my union job at the Morton Salt mine and got an FBI record that clings for life like the adhesive &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;stickum&quot;&lt;/a&gt; substance that athletes use to improve their grip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I went on to conduct other, nonviolent, peace demonstrations at Air Force nuclear missile silos and Navy bases where nuclear weapons are either stored or deployed. I have consequently been arrested and/or jailed multiple times in Arkansas, Missouri, Georgia, Texas and North Dakota, and have therefore spent a total of more than a year and a half of my life in a dozen different jails and prisons in those states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Most recently I was jailed for 100 days in North Dakota in 2010 for staging a nonviolent, peace demonstration on Minuteman III nuclear missile silo Hero-8, a few miles southwest of Parshall, North Dakota. That is on the Fort Berthold - Three Affiliated Tribes Reservation. The silo is but a very short distance from the intersection of 33rd Street and 76th Avenue. Don&#39;t be fooled, these are long, featureless gravel roads way out in the boonies. That&#39;s just the way they name the roads in the middle of rural nowhere in North Dakota.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It was a chilly morning on 15 April. I issued my &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Minot Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; to the press the same day. It is one of my most important writings, ever, and so few people even trouble themselves to read it. I have written a little about my preparation for that demonstration in my earlier post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2014/06/very-real-danger-of-nuclear-armageddon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Very Real Danger of Nuclear Armageddon&lt;/a&gt;. I ended up being jailed for most of the time in Rugby, North Dakota in the Heart of America jail, so-called because Rugby is located at the geographical center of the North American continent. Not to say that it was a pleasant place, or that the social environment was congenial, but at one level it was as if the continent itself had clasped me to its bosom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Not only is there an ongoing threat of a general nuclear war, an all out nuclear exchange, but the continuing crisis at Fukushima, Japan, and also Chernobyl, Ukraine, remains unresolved. There are several hundreds of nuclear reactors on this planet. The ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima have already melted down and/or exploded and the issue with all of the others is that they potentially can, too. In fact, there is every possibility that one or more of the others, perhaps even many of the others, will also melt down and/or explode, for any of a variety of reasons, including poor maintenance, sabotage or terrorism, natural disasters, societal collapse, war, etc. There are unknown thousands of tons of highly toxic nuclear waste that no one knows how to safely dispose of or store over the long term, i.e., tens or hundreds of thousands of years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;As it happens, the Fukushima disaster alone may prove to be an extinction level event for much of the life in the Pacific Ocean region, and perhaps for the planet as a whole. It is ongoing and may worsen in coming years, perhaps greatly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Probably not coincidentally the Fukushima crisis occurred just a few months after my decision to depart the USSA and look inward, within the hyper-conscious, living biosphere of the planet for powerful, inner-life direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lure of South America and the Amazon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Not long after my release from jail in North Dakota I traveled to Ecuador to pursue a shamanic vision quest that I had keenly anticipated and nevertheless put off for most of my adult life. I decided that if ever I were to do it, that 2010 was the time. So I bought a plane ticket to Quito and semi-unknowingly embarked on another phase of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Within days I was in the Upper Amazon, in Napo province, drinking &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; for the first time.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I had read a lot of accounts written by others who had drunk &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt;, but it ended up being very different for me. I saw no anacondas or jaguars or aliens or visions of other planets or ancient Atlantis -- none of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Instead, what &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; showed me was that the Earth and humanity are under a withering assault by a sort of thing that I have decided to call &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;. While it is immensely conscious, and is tremendously self-aware, it possesses a peculiar sort of soulless consciousness, without a living spirit connection to the Divine, that I could see. I perceived its intent as thoroughly demonic, as a total repudiation of the noble, edifying, loving, vital. life nourishing aspect of Creation. It is relentless; it is without remorse, compassion or pity. It will not stop coming. It will use anyone or anything to achieve its goal, which appears to be total domination, subjugation, conquest and even total destruction of the Earth and humanity, if it comes to that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It operates in the physical, 3-D realm and also in the astral or near astral realm. I perceive it as an artificial construct that does not have its own life essence, as it is not a natural life form with a hyper-dimensional DNA connection to divine levels of Creation. Instead, it siphons off the vital life energy of human beings for its own use, as an energy source, in a doomed, never-ending attempt to fill up the unfillable void it feels within itself. It is thoroughly vampiric and profoundly entropic. If I had to pinpoint a physical location for this &lt;i&gt;Machine&lt;/i&gt;, one of the places I would look would be in vast caverns beneath the Moon&#39;s surface, or maybe inside of Iapetus, orbiting around Saturn. Please understand that the technology involved is very exotic, very powerful and subtle, Machiavellian beyond belief, cold and calculating, and operates in multiple dimensions with great sophistication -- in the astral realm, in the physical realm, in the emotional realm, in the social realm, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s hard to wrap your mind around this entity. It is like an alien, demonic, global vampire that knows how to push humanity&#39;s buttons to get the results it wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Someone or something&amp;nbsp; created &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;. It occurs to me that it may be a very sophisticated weapon of war, with an extremely high level A.I. operating system. For all I know it goes planet hopping through solar system after solar system, with a default setting to mayhem, slaughter, death and destruction. We live in a big galaxy, and an even larger universe. It is naive to believe that all the beings and technologies out there are benevolent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In my view, it is intimately tied up with the dark force behind the endless warring of the Pentagon, the global narcotics trade, human trafficking, exploitive, central-bank-warfare models of economics,&amp;nbsp; GMO technology, chemtrails, rampant deforestation, corporations like Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Chemical, General Electric, etc., agencies like the CIA, NSA, MI-6, Mossad, etc., nanotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, nuclear technology in all of its most insidious manifestations, and much more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It is malevolent beyond the power of words to describe. I have discussed this &lt;i&gt;Machine &lt;/i&gt;in other blog posts, e.g.,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2014/03/ayahuasca-dreaming-machine-grinds-on.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ayahuasca Dreaming: The Machine Grinds On&lt;/a&gt;. One of my friends asked me to let her view &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; and this is what she had to say about it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today I woke in the small hours and realized that you had made the experience   available to me.&amp;nbsp; I understood something that my inexperience with power plants  and the word  &quot;visions&quot; had previously kept from me: that what occurs in visions is a direct, real  encounter with the thing itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And you have done this many times. Your courage is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The construct was covered with a translucent white membrane, which I realized  was my  protections. They are automatic but can be repealed. I lifted up the membrane and directly  observed the construct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was frankly demonic. It calls to human beings to give in to the worst of their motives; the  ultimate result is not satiation but destruction.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;….. Believe me, this is a very different morning from any other that I have experienced. The  hard demonic quality underlies the bright morning like the taste of brass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeper Into The Heart of The Amazon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I continued my exploration of reality with a growing sense of the enormity of the challenge facing those who hope to save the Earth&#39;s biosphere and at least a remnant of humanity. Through a volunteer tourist program I was directed to an Amazonian shaman with whom I ended up living the entire year of 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I drank a fair amount of &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; during that year, and also &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt;, another entheogen that grows widely in the Amazon region. I would caution one and all that &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt;, also known as angel&#39;s trumpet or Brugmansia, must be used &lt;u&gt;very&lt;/u&gt; carefully. There are hundreds of different varieties and subvarieties, out of which perhaps five can be used for conscious exploration of the natural spirit world, and &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; under the careful guidance of an experienced, ethical, trustworthy shaman or shamaness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I learned a great deal about Amazonian shamanism during 2012, both the good and also the very bad, including things that I could never have anticipated in my wildest imaginings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;First the good part: Nature is vastly, consciously alive.The forest is filled with all kinds of spirits. Insect spirits, plant and tree spirits, animal spirits, spirits of light, wind spirits, bird spirits, reptile spirits and human spirits of various ethnicities and races, both male and female.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In other words, speaking as a man of western European ancestry, my personal observation is that the stories we are taught are myths or fairy tales are in actuality true!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;There really are pixies, faeries, elves, leprechauns,&amp;nbsp; sprites, trolls, kobolds, gnomes, pucks, etc. Especially in the forest, but not only there, we are surrounded by a wide variety of spirits. We pass our lives immersed in a spiritual landscape that most people remain perfectly oblivious to, most of the time, and at their peril, if for no other reason than that when they die, and the physical body falls away, they find themselves suddenly plunged headlong into a multi-dimensional spiritual reality that they willfully denied and consciously avoided their entire lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Perhaps my favorite spirits are the Tree People who came around multiple times. They are very gentle and radiate an aura of good natured, benevolent intent. I repeat that Nature is hyper-consciously aware and full of spiritual beings. The forest is awake and aware. That was brought home to me with powerful immediacy in the year I spent with the shaman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;During that year I specifically asked &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; one evening to show me the near future, which it did with a sobering directness. It showed me a frankly totalitarian dictatorship, replete with detention camps, military vehicles,&amp;nbsp; guard towers and security fences, and shimmering overhead in the air was a sort of quasi-physical-ephemeral net or grid that I was given to know telepathically was a mechanism for complete control of every aspect of human behavior, activity, thought, emotion and spiritual impulse. And all around I saw the wild forest, the forest primeval. This hell vision pertained to the human realm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It was a grim scenario. I saw it as if watching it on a flat-panel computer monitor or television screen. I thought that perhaps &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; had misunderstood my question, so I inwardly posed it again. About a minute later, precisely the same vision materialized once more before my inner view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I thought, &quot;God help us.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And then in mid-2013 came the Edward Snowden revelations about the global NSA spying,&amp;nbsp; coupled with story after story of the federal agencies in the USSA buying up &lt;u&gt;billions&lt;/u&gt; of rounds of hollow point sniper ammunition (the kind that will blow a hole the size of a dinner plate right through you), and then there is the rapidly increasing militarization of community policing all over the USSA, more than 2 million people in jail, and so it goes. I was born and reared in the USSA, about 75% of the readers of this blog live in the USSA, and the USSA still (at least as of today) exercises strong influence throughout the world -- economically, militarily, diplomatically, culturally, socially, etc., so for me, the readers of this blog, and for much of the rest of the world, the vision I was shown has considerable import; the more so, as its essential aspects are being put into play right before our eyes. An authoritarian or totalitarian system is rapidly being set into place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And overall most of the people are acquiescing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s a big problem. The people are cooperating with tyranny. They are in &quot;go along to get along&quot; mode and it will be their complete undoing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;As I said, there are numerous varieties of &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt; in tropical South America and a lot of them can hurt you very badly. One of the poisonous varieties was growing right in front of my hut. I knew that because the shaman pointed it out to me more than once and told me not to touch it. So I left it alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dark Side of Amazonian Shamanism&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Then everything changed. The morning of 29 December 2012 I went with the shaman into the little woods beside his place to drink &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt;. Because of what subsequently transpired&amp;nbsp; I will not describe now, and maybe never, everything that happened that day. Suffice it to say that the actions of the shaman that day and the following night hurt me so badly that I very nearly died. He almost killed me. I ended up spending more than four months in the public hospitals in Ecuador. I cannot tell you the agonizing depths of the pain in the first several weeks. It was off the chart. The pain killers the doctors gave me didn&#39;t touch it.&amp;nbsp; My case flummoxed the medical experts and so finally they discharged me, after months of testing and probing me, inside and out, up, down and sideways. The day of my hospital discharge, I barely made it across the small hospital parking lot with the aid of a battered aluminum walker, and could go no farther. I hailed a cab to take me to a low priced boarding house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;More than&amp;nbsp; a year later I am still recuperating, slowly getting a little better, month by month. It has been a long, slow, painful process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Looking back on what happened that day, I noticed when I finally made it back to my little hut, literally half-dead, that the fatally poisonous variety of &lt;i&gt;malicagua &lt;/i&gt;in front of my hut that the shaman had warned me about was conspicuously gone. It wasn&#39;t there anymore. In light of the near-fatal abuse I suffered that day and night, I have since wondered if he perhaps gave me that normally fatal variety of &lt;i&gt;malicagua &lt;/i&gt;to drink that morning. I can&#39;t say for sure. All I know is that I came close to death that day and night. It was a near thing, a real close call.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Which brings me around to the main point of this section of the post: there are some real dark characters involved in Amazonian shamanism and it is not always easy to identify them. In my case, I came to that shaman through an Ecuadorian volunteer and tourism web site. Many people came and went during the year I stayed with the shaman. The shaman was a&amp;nbsp; bit unconventional, but I never saw him do to anyone what he did to me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;On the contrary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And then things took a very dark turn, with me as the direct target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In the interim, I have learned by a variety of means that the problem of rogue shamans, &lt;i&gt;brujos&lt;/i&gt;, sorcerers and indigenous criminal predators, jungle riffraff, call them what you will, is a very real issue in the Amazon region. Governments recognize it, the indigenous communities recognize it and still it goes on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I thought I was avoiding all of that by going to a shaman who was recommended by a tourism and volunteer business, and who had a regular stream of tourists and spiritual seekers coming to him and his place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;People get killed by so-called &quot;shamans&quot; every year in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil. A real shaman or shamaness, who has your best interests at heart, who is skilled with the plants of the jungle, who knows the human body and spirit, who is able to guide you physically, emotionally and spiritually as you delve into &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; or the other plants of the region such as &lt;i&gt;San Pedro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt;, is a real rare breed. They exist, but they are rare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;How do you find them? Luck, good karma, knowing the right people, which could mean&amp;nbsp; living in the region for years and really getting to know the culture and the people at a deeper level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And then there is the idea that &quot;98% of people shouldn&#39;t even drink &lt;i&gt;ayahasca&lt;/i&gt;&quot; as one of my South American oracles has advised me. &quot;They can&#39;t handle it. They can&#39;t handle what it shows them. They flip out.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve seen people fly in on their South American vacation. For them, South America is like a tropical theme park with mountains, jungle, sea shore. It&#39;s on their bucket list. They fly to the Galapagos. They photograph the tortoises. They go to Cali to dance in the salsa clubs. They visit Machu Picchu to photograph the Inca ruins. Then they travel into the Amazon to drink &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt;. There is no particular depth to what they are doing. It&#39;s all on a par with taking photos at Mach Picchu or dancing in a nightclub in Cali. Then they fly back to Soho or Madison or Chicago or Boston.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Been there, done that, they say. It&#39;s so superficial. And the &quot;shamans&quot; are there to accommodate them, or maybe kill them. And every year some do get killed; others get badly injured or nearly killed, as I was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And this from a shaman with whom I lived an entire year, and with whom I had drunk the shamanic plants many times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Criminal Case&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;There are many things I can and do shrug off, ignore, let go, forget about or even forgive. Being almost killed is a different matter altogether. There was never an apology from the shaman to me for causing my near death; moreover, both during and after the events of that day and night there was never any hint of remorse. And there were other factors surrounding those events that made plain to me that the man needs to be stopped and that I am the one to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;So I filed a criminal complaint against him. Everything that I have learned since has ratified my decision to do that. The case has made its way through the system and there will probably be a trial soon. He has been indicted, and the court will soon make a decision as to whether and when to take the case to trial. If he is tried and convicted he could potentially serve many years in jail. Causing great bodily harm is a serious matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The process has drug out for more than a year and a half, and has cost me thousands of dollars to pay attorneys, and also medical and rehabilitation fees. It has been a devastating experience, not at all what I anticipated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;However, I regard it as important to stand up and struggle for justice under very difficult circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The reality is that this is how it is going to be, if we are to get our planet back. There are violent rogues at every level of the world system, from Washington, DC to the Middle East to the Amazon and every point in between. We do not get our planet back unless we deal with them. That&#39;s just the way it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;If you think you can do that by just browsing your favorite Internet sites or sitting in your living room drinking beer and watching news clips from Gaza or Ukraine on TV, think again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;We are in a down and dirty, life and death struggle for the destiny of humankind and the planet itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;To flourish on this planet we have to get to a much deeper level of understanding. We&#39;re skating on the surface now, just splashing in the shallows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Shamanism, a mature, spiritually deep shamanism, is one of the greatest tools we have to reestablish a hyper-conscious, harmonious, cooperative, collaborative, working and living relationship with the Earth, and with all of the myriad biological, geological, crystalline, electrical, etheric, plasmoid and spiritual life forms on the Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But if the shamanistic conduit is all clogged up with all manner of sorcerers, &lt;i&gt;brujos&lt;/i&gt; and criminal predators laying in wait to bushwhack seekers after deeper communion with Nature, then that is a serious issue that needs to be resolved.&amp;nbsp; Someone has to clear the way. We absolutely must reestablish a clear channel of hyper-conscious communication with Nature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;So at great personal expense of time, effort, money, and pain I am doing my best to put a dangerous shaman behind bars. He&#39;s not the only one, but you start where you can, and you go from there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Political Refuge Issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;At the same time, I am seeking political refuge in Ecuador.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Beyond the fact that I do not know if there was possibly a hidden (maybe CIA or USSA military?)&amp;nbsp; hand in the ugly events that befell me, the USSA has changed greatly in the time I have been in Ecuador. The month after I was discharged from the hospital, Edward Snowden&#39;s NSA revelations came to light. Now we know that everyone is under surveillance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You are.

The NDAA even permits the outright killing of those whom the executive branch of the USSA government determines to be a threat, whatever the secret criteria are. There is no way to know if you are on the list, right up until the time you are grabbed off the street by guys with guns who put a hood over your head and take you away to some secret, USSA military dungeon. Or maybe a Pentagon hit man just walks up to you on the street and calmly pumps a few bullets into you, turns the corner, hails a cab and rides away, while you bleed out on the sidewalk. It&#39;s made to seem like random street crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the way that the NDAA works. It is now the law. I therefore presume that it is in operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Those factors, given my history of anti-nuclear activism and multiple arrests and stints in many different jails and prisons; along with my writing and research about black budget operations pertaining especially to clandestine underground and undersea bases and tunnels; as well as this blog, in which I take all kinds of unconventional positions on a wide variety of issues; have all brought me to the point where I feel it wiser to remain in South America, and specifically in Ecuador. No doubt my penetrating foray into shamanism and the hyper-dimensionally vibrant world of the Amazon have also brought me to the notice of those who would prefer the resident human population to be deaf, dumb, blind and thoroughly docile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;My political refuge petition is accordingly into its second year.

It seems like an outlandish idea at first blush. But there is evidence that points in that direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Dyna-Soar &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Most people have never heard of the USSA Air Force’s preparations for the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dyna-Soar manned space program&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Dyna-Soar was based on the 1930s theoretical boost-glide space plane concept of the 20th Century German scientist, Eugen Sänger. Nazi rocket expert, SS General Walter Dornberger, was brought to the USA by Project Paperclip after World War II and carried along schematics and blueprints for a rocket launched space plane based on Eugen Sänger’s earlier work. In my book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files&lt;/a&gt;, I reference two Project Paperclip memoranda from 1947 that explicitly asked for both SS General Dornberger and Eugen Sänger to be brought over to the USSA under Project Paperclip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;General Dornberger &lt;u&gt;was&lt;/u&gt; brought over and worked for Bell Aircraft, in upstate New York, where he advanced the space plane concept under the guise of the USSA&#39;s Air Force’s Dyna-Soar project. Initially, Bell’s design for the Dyna-Soar was the leading concept, but then the Air Force decided to award the project to Boeing instead.&amp;nbsp; (The best history that I have seen of this project, and its Nazi antecedents, is the conference article by William C. Walter, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Dyna-Soar: The Roots of Shuttle - A Memoir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, IAA-92-0193, 43rd Congress of the International Astronautical Federation, August 28-September 5, 1992, Washington, DC (International Astronautical Federation, 3-5 Rue Mario-Nikis, 75015 Paris, France).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In plain English, NASA&#39;s space shuttle was not home-grown American technology. It actually was an outgrowth of&amp;nbsp; a concept based on Nazi research and plans dating back to the era of the Third Reich, in the 1930s and 1940s, albeit that it took the USSA a few decades after WW-II to build and fly a spacecraft that resembled the original Nazi concept. The original intent was to orbit the Dyna-Soar. Publicly, that program was shut down; however, with a delay of over a decade the Space Shuttle, a larger, boost-glide, space plane was launched and did orbit hundreds of astronauts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, Neil Armstrong, the celebrated first man to walk on the moon in NASA’s Apollo space program, was one of the Dyna-Soar space plane astronauts before he left Dyna-Soar to train with NASA. Eventually, after spending a lot of money and time, and training a Dyna-Soar astronaut corps, the Air Force publicly announced that it was shutting down the program, allegedly without ever putting any Dyna-Soar astronauts into space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The USSA Air Force also planned to establish a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)&lt;/a&gt;, and in the period 1965-1967 selected yet another corps of military astronauts. The Air Force’s MOL astronaut corps operated in parallel to the NASA manned space program’s astronaut corps. But then, as with the earlier Dyna-Soar program, the Air Force announced that it was shutting down the MOL program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Horizon &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And then there were the USSA Army&#39;s plans for a major program to establish a manned outpost on the Moon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/an-army-base-on-the-moon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It was called Project Horizon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and projected scores of Saturn rocket launches of men and materiel into space, to construct a manned lunar base by 1966. Officially, nothing like this came to concrete realization, and the first Apollo astronauts did not set foot on the lunar surface until 1969, three years after the projected date of completion of the USSA Army&#39;s planned, manned lunar base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The public record therefore shows that the USSA military planned at least three manned space programs in the 1950s and 1960s (Dyna-Soar, the MOL and Project Horizon) that were distinctly separate from the NASA Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. The Air Force trained its own military astronauts for the Dyna-Soar and MOL programs, before very publicly shutting them down for ostensible lack of funding and political support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The USSA Military&#39;s Parallel Secret Space Shuttle Program&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But was the story presented to the public really the whole story? The question has to be asked, because in August of 1989 the U.S. Air Force announced for yet a third time that it was shutting down another, this time &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/07/us/pentagon-leaves-the-shuttle-program.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret, manned space program that it again intended to run parallel to that of NASA’s manned space program&lt;/a&gt;. In this case the Pentagon had spent $3.3 billion dollars to build its own space shuttle launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, a launch control facility in Colorado, and had a secret cadre of 32 military astronauts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, none of this was public knowledge until the 1989 announcement by the Air Force that it had disbanded its secret, previously unknown, astronaut corps, that it was “mothballing” its space shuttle launch facility at Vandenberg AFB, and that it was abandoning its space shuttle program. There were therefore three publicly acknowledged efforts by the U.S. military over a 30 year period to establish its own manned space programs. In each case, the programs were publicly shut down, but only after first going to elaborate and costly lengths of training astronauts, developing technology and spending multiple billions of dollars. This represents quite a lot of repeated effort over a period of decades to obtain a null result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless of course, this repeated exercise over a 30 year period was but a costly charade carefully calculated to deflect scrutiny from other military programs that actually have secretly put men into space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have often wondered whether something like the USSA Army&#39;s Project Horizon (see above) may even now be in secret operation, with manned outposts on the Moon, and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, and even farther afield in the galaxy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curious Case of Gary McKinnon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me directly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XacevWeOkHg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the curious case of Gary McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, the British computer hacker who was hauled up on serious criminal charges by the U.S. government for hacking into U.S. government and military computer networks. As of early 2010 McKinnon was facing 70 years in prison for hacking into U.S. Space Command computers, where he alleges to have seen computer files with lists of Non-Terrestrial Officers’ names, and records of fleet to fleet transfers containing names of ships that he says were not U.S. Navy ships. What he saw caused him to believe that the U.S. military has a secret space fleet and that the ships’ names that he viewed belong to that secret space fleet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Be that as it may, whatever it was that he saw caused the U.S. Government to go to unusual lengths to try to extradite Gary McKinnon to the USA and criminally prosecute and imprison him for the rest of his natural life. Judging by the extreme reaction of the U.S. Government to what would seem to be an otherwise comparatively minor hacking incident, maybe it really does have a secret space fleet. Maybe that’s why it went after Gary McKinnon so aggressively. Maybe the repeated, publicly “failed” or abandoned attempts by the U.S. Air Force to establish a separate, military, manned space program were just covers for another, more secretive manned space program that had quietly flown beneath the radar of public awareness until a bumbling British hacker stumbled across it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Area 51 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In that vein, much speculation has focused on the famous Area 51 in Nevada, and the Lockheed Corporation’s famous “Skunk Words” in California, as sites where secret spacecraft may have been developed and built. After all, it was Lockheed’s “Skunk Works” where super-secret aircraft such as the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 stealth fighter were designed and built. And Area 51 is widely assumed to be a place where reverse engineering of recovered extraterrestrial technology takes place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;One of the most interesting anecdotal accounts of the extraterrestrial technology held at Area 51 that I have seen appeared in a 2002 Robert Stanley interview with David Adair in NEXUS Magazine. (Robert M. Stanley, “Electromagnetic Fusion and ET Space Technology,” &lt;i&gt;NEXUS New Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt; USA/Canadian Edition, vol. 9, no. 5 (September-October 2002): 53-57, 74-75.) Briefly, Adair says that in 1971 he was taken underground at Area 51 to a mammoth, underground, work space where he saw many exotic craft, including a large, bus-sized, fusion engine that was so exotic and sophisticated that it was clear to him that it was of extraterrestrial manufacture and could not have been made on Earth. The plain implication is that the military-industrial complex of the USA has extraterrestrial space engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We Now Have The Technology To Take E.T. Home&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But it was the dramatic comments in 1993 of&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?t=134594&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Ben Rich, director of the Lockheed Skunk Works&lt;/a&gt; from 1975 to 1990, that conclusively revealed that great technological advances have been made in the black world of compartmentalized programs. In March of 1993 Rich presented a talk to an engineering alumni meeting at the University of California- Los Angeles (UCLA). Jan Harzen, a Boeing executive and Director of the Mutual UFO Network’s Orange County section, was present in the audience that day. Harzan witnessed Rich show a slide of a black flying disk headed into outer space and tell the audience of engineers, “We now have the technology to take E.T. home.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Ben Rich went on to say that by making changes in unspecified mathematical equations there had been an engineering breakthrough and that it did not take long to travel to other stars. In recent years, a letter written by Rich in 1986 has also come to light in which he wrote: “Many of our manmade UFOs are Un Funded Opportunities.” This comment by Ben Rich clearly refers to black budget, off the books projects and technology. The clear reference to “manmade UFOs” is unambiguous and carries extra weight coming from Rich, who was an insider’s insider in the American military-industrial complex, particularly in the secretive world of high-tech, cutting edge, aerospace technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Information From My Own Sources And Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I must say that none of this surprises me in the least. My personal view is that manned space flight in the modern era likely began in the early 1950s, a full decade before the Russians and Americans began publicly catapulting astronauts and cosmonauts into space in hypersonic tomato cans called &quot;space capsules.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;My belief is that from the time of the Third Reich on (or even before) electrogravitics, antigravity and other modes of propulsion were being explored.&amp;nbsp; I have explained my thinking and observations at length in previous blog posts, among others:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2014/05/nazi-vril-kaleidoscopic-merry-go-round.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nazi Vril Kaleidoscopic Merry-Go-Round&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2013/07/unthinkable-torsion-secrets-of-our-most.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unthinkable Torsion Secrets Of Our Most Recondite Delusion&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2011/12/vorticular-madness-of-dark-magicians.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vorticular Madness Of The Dark Magicians&lt;/a&gt; . The work of T. Townsend Brown, Charles Dellschau, the Nazi scientists and engineers, and a host of others, as well as the technology recovered from the Roswell&amp;nbsp; UFO crash in 1947 and other UFO crashes, absolutely did not escape the notice of the planners behind Project Paperclip, the Manhattan Project,&amp;nbsp; MJ-12, the Jason Group, Project Rand and other organizations and research groups dealing with exotic and cutting edge technology. In fact, the modern space effort appears to have begun in earnest many decades ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In my book, &lt;i&gt;Kundalini Tales&lt;/i&gt;, I very briefly refer to a clear telepathic communication&amp;nbsp; that I received from Robert Monroe, the well-known out-of-body explorer and author who founded The Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia. For whatever reason, I had a fair amount of telepathic contact with Robert Monroe over the years. Of course, he is not presently physically alive. In about 1981, he telepathically communicated to me that the first men went into space in 1951 (not 1961) and that the first space missions revealed that there were certain esoteric aspects to space travel, things that NASA, for instance, has never publicly revealed. Essentially, there is a deeply magical or mystical aspect of space travel -- it&#39;s not all nuts and bolts, hard engineering. There are certain key times and places, and specific manners in which you can send men to space. If the proper protocols are not observed the missions do not succeed. That was the gist of what he communicated to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;More than that, other information I have received has suggested that the huge black triangles that so many people have seen, in different regions of the world, are a compartmentalized, Black Project of major aerospace companies that uses plasma technology as a propulsive force. The observed performance of the craft is consistent with some sort of alectrogravitic or antigravity technology. The same is probably true for the Nazi Vril-style flying saucers that have been repeatedly seen over the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I would also observe that when I was researching my first book on underground bases and tunnels, I ran across a technical document that mentioned a planned, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nuclear powered, tunnel boring machine called a &lt;b&gt;Subselene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designed to&amp;nbsp; excavate tunnels beneath the Moon&#39;s surface. I briefly mention the Subselene &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;toward the end of the book&lt;/a&gt;. The document even estimated the cost of transporting the machine to the Moon, without, however, specifying exactly &lt;u&gt;how&lt;/u&gt; that would be done. At the time, I wondered to myself if that could perhaps be done with a big, heavy lift, black triangle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Twenty years later,&amp;nbsp; I am still wondering about that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bottom Line &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the available evidence indicates the likely existence of at least one classified, military space program using chemical rocket technology, and operating clandestinely, in parallel to the NASA manned space program. Additionally, the comments of Ben Rich and the remarks of David Adair indicate the probable existence of at least one other highly secret space program, using unconventional space technology, also operating in parallel to the NASA manned space program. The aggressive pursuit of criminal charges by the American government against the British hacker, Gary McKinnon, who alleges to have seen evidence of a secret U.S. military space fleet also points to a secret American space program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black budget is massive, running into the hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars. The evidence strongly indicates that a lot of that money has gone into secretive activities in space about which we have never been informed. At places like Area 51, Vandenberg Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Edwards Air Force Base, Cape Canaveral and elsewhere there are profound secrets about space and space travel that have been held back from the American people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general public have been massively lied to. The time has come that we learned the truth about what happens in those places, the many discoveries and breakthroughs that have been made, and the technology that is in use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will You Please Help Me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;After   more than a year of intense struggle, the shaman who assaulted me has   been  indicted and has now been arraigned.

The majority of the world’s population knows very little about this ambitious program, and remains ignorant of what is happening undersea and underground. This has been going on at least since the end of World War II.&amp;nbsp; A lot of it may have started with the Nazi engineers in the Third Reich, but it absolutely did &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; end with them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I provide a great deal of information about these bases in the three books that are advertised in the right-hand sidebar of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Because I passed 90% of my life in the USSA, my work has a particular focus on that country. I reveal many of the major players in this decades-long project, many of the facilities themselves, and some of what is known about the activities that take place in them. It has to be said that a great deal still remains unknown about what is taking place underground and undersea. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Many governments have contracted with major civil and marine engineering firms to construct massive installations underground and undersea. These bases are found in many countries, including the USSA, Russia, China, Switzerland, Norway, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The technology to construct manned bases down in the bedrock deep beneath the seafloor in mid-ocean has existed for almost half a century now. In 1966 the USSA Navy’s so-called Rock-Site concept revealed that the technical expertise in the petroleum, mining and marine engineering industries made possible the construction of large, permanently manned facilities deep beneath the seafloor, hundreds of miles offshore in mid-ocean. I discuss the Rock-Site plans in my book &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UUB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Underwater and Underground Bases&lt;/a&gt;, and also in my later book,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In 1968 researchers affiliated with the Stanford Research Institute in California recommended constructing thirty undersea bases, at a projected cost of less than $3 billion dollars. Their report suggested that the deep undersea bases could be multipurpose facilities, for joint industrial, scientific and military use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;A growing body of evidence indicates that such bases have been built by the Americans, and perhaps by others as well. Bodies of water such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea, the South China Sea and East China Sea, the coastal waters of the continental shelves worldwide, as well as all other major seas and oceans are all candidate sites for deep, permanently manned bases. In fact the technology exists to conduct major industrial and military operations at extreme depths of 20,000 feet in mid-ocean. The major military agencies of the world and civil, petroleum, mining and marine engineering corporations have had the capability to construct these bases for decades. Reported or planned uses for these undersea facilities are as clandestine submarine bases, sonar bases, industrial mineral extraction operations (mining), alien bases, nuclear missile bases and scientific research installations. Note that all of these bases are presently clandestine and that there are likely to be other uses, perhaps even more exotic than those listed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Marine and civil engineering technology also permit the construction of massive bases in the world’s coastal regions that incorporate elements of both undersea and underground bases. The massive base that the Chinese military has reportedly constructed on Hainan Island is a good example. This huge, underground base can accommodate as many as 20 large, nuclear missile firing submarines underground beneath the island. The submarines reportedly do not surface to enter their base. They come and go from the base through multiple underwater tunnels that open directly to the deep sea and lead straight from the secret, underground submarine base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In the late Soviet period the Russians were also making a similar facility for their enormous Typhoon class, nuclear missile firing submarines. The Russian base is reported to be on the Kola Peninsula about 150 miles from Murmansk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have been told that the USSA Navy also has built similar underground and undersea submarine bases. The Israeli Navy is reported to have such a base on the Mediterranean coast. Military marine engineering has science-fiction-like capabilities to make huge, deep, undersea and underground tunnels for submarines. Technology in the Black Budget world has far outstripped the reality that we know in our everyday lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;There are many secret underground bases all over the world. The Americans have numerous highly secret underground bases, including at their mysterious UFO research base in Nevada called Area 51. Many other nations also have secret underground bases. The Swiss Alps, for example, are said to be tunneled like Swiss cheese! The massive underground base beneath Yamantau Mountain in the southern Ural region of Russia is almost as legendary as Area 51 in the USA. The huge, Pine Gap underground facility in the middle of the Australian Outback is equally mysterious. Our planet is home to myriad facilities such as these. Many thousands, maybe even millions of people in total, are involved in building, maintaining and operating these highly secretive underground and undersea facilities – and yet the general public is kept completely in the dark as to what happens in them, or even where most of them are located.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Most of the world’s cities sit atop a literal warren or maze of underground tunnels and passages that can extend down hundreds of feet or more. The ancient catacombs that lie under Rome and Paris are well known. The gritty, dirty subways of New York City, the magnificent metro system of Moscow, and the jam packed rush hour subways of Tokyo, are equally world renowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The ultra-secret tunnels that lie under some of the world’s most famous cities are less well known. For instance, most tourists who visit Washington, DC never suspect that a veritable labyrinth lies beneath their feet. They visit the White House without thinking of the secret, deep underground tunnels that radiate out from it to other locations in the city. They never suspect the elaborate, subterranean installation buried deep beneath the White House that extends down underground, level after level after level. They never have heard of the Top Secret plans in the 1960s to make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret underground base 3,500 feet below ground&lt;/a&gt;, with high speed elevators connecting to the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon, and a high speed, deep underground shuttle connector between the base and the elevators. And that is just a fraction of the subterranean secrets that Washington, DC conceals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Other major cities such as London, Moscow, Beijing, and Tokyo have their own secret tunnel systems. The so-called ruling elite have been burrowing underground for untold centuries – we are just late in awakening to their secret, subterranean lairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Even stranger and more secret are the many reported bases of extraterrestrials that lie beneath the surface of the land and sea. I first heard these rumors in the late 1980s and they so fired my curiosity that they played an important role in the research and writing of my first book on the topic: &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Underground Bases and Tunnels: What Is The Government Trying To Hide?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t uncover any open-literature evidence of aliens in underground bases while researching that book, but I found convincing evidence of major underground bases, and USSA government planning and research&amp;nbsp; for a major tunnel network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Growing numbers of people have reported being taken underground or undersea and seeing clandestine facilities. I have heard some of these stories myself. I take them seriously. In some cases these so-called &quot;abductees&quot; also report seeing aliens working with terrestrial humans, including American military forces. Other human beings are sometimes seen who appear to be extraterrestrials. The implication is that there are other planets in the Milky Way Galaxy with human populations that we have not been told about. Highly strange activities have been reported in some of the underground bases involving genetic engineering, human cloning, mind control, and other technologies which we lack the appropriate language to even describe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;One engineer with whom I spoke spent his entire career maintaining large, extremely high-tech, industrial production facilities in secret, deep underground bases in the continental USSA. Part of what he described to me can only be interpreted as having to do with cyborg technology -- the marriage of living protoplasm and electronic technology. He frankly told me that though he remembered the majority of his career underground, that there were parts of it that remained blank in his mind, chunks of missing time that he could not consciously account for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Others have alleged the existence of supersonic, underground magnetic levitation (maglev) trains that hurtle through a sprawling, continent-wide, deeply buried tunnel system. Can there be such a clandestine, subterranean train system built by the Shadow Government in great secrecy? My research answers a resounding, yes, it is very possible. In fact, the open record shows that just such a system was under active research and development all the way back in the 1930s, in the Third Reich of Nazi Germany. While it is not known if the Nazis ever built such a secret, maglev, tube shuttle, train network, the stories persist that such a system exists today, that it is very fast, very deep and very secret, for use only by the Shadow Government’s clandestine, compartmentalized projects. In my books, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UUB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Underwater and Underground Bases&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files&lt;/a&gt;, I provide documentation from the open technical literature that demonstrates a decades-long, multi-agency research effort into high speed maglev trains. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have mentioned many times in my public lectures and articles the literal TRILLIONS of dollars that have gone conspicuously missing from the Pentagon&#39;s budget alone, over just the past 20 years or so. I have no doubt that a big chunk of that money has been poured into extremely high-tech, secret, underground and undersea bases and tunnels. I make the case for this in my books, which are linked to above, in the text of this article and also advertised in the right-hand sidebar of &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You may be sure of this much: we are living in a world of very great illusion, delusion and profound deceit. To use a metaphor from the blockbuster movie, &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;, this little article is your “red pill.” You have the choice of rejecting the information that it contains, or, alternatively, of reading it and opening your eyes to the sober reality of the world as it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I agree with those who maintain that a highly clandestine, extremely compartmentalized, highly technologically advanced civilization has been developed parallel to the dumbed down, crime ridden, war wracked, poverty-stricken, global society that the vast majority of us are born into and spend our lives in. Both are terrestrial, human societies. Both occupy the same planet. But they remain largely separate, one from the other, by conscious design. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It seems incredible, but a growing body of research, mine included, points to that conclusion. The following 1950s-era quote, attributed to J. Edgar Hoover, applies very well to our situation: &lt;b&gt;&quot;... (T)he individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The context of&amp;nbsp; Hoover&#39;s remarks had to do with the threat of Communism, but the comment clearly is fungible, in that it could just as well describe the predicament we face today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;We are faced with a situation where many trillions of dollars are being sucked out of the global economy, impoverishing billions of people, and yet we have no realistic idea of where the money is going, or what it is being used for. It&#39;s as if there is a parallel universe, established cheek by jowl with the realm we inhabit; we can see its effects on our daily lives, we can sense its deeply disruptive presence, and yet we cannot directly observe it; it remains frustratingly just out of our reach, just beyond or ken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I surmise that that is because a great deal of it is underground and undersea. And also off planet, in orbit and perhaps elsewhere in this solar system and beyond. But that is a topic for another installment of this blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Of course, there are plenty of people who will remonstrate: &quot;Yeah. Right. Look here, Richard, if something like that were going on, I would certainly know about it and I haven&#39;t ever seen any mention of it on FOX TV, or CNN, or MSNBC or CBS.

USSA politics &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; about to be upended -- and how! The whole body politic is in ferment and turmoil, and about to become even more volatile than it already is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;There are a bunch of factors. Just a few of the most salient are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; The USSA is bankrupt, up, down and sideways, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailysheeple.com/the-united-states-of-debt-total-debt-in-america-hits-a-new-record-high-of-nearly-60-trillion-dollars_062014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a total societal debt of almost 60 trillion dollars&lt;/a&gt;. With that level of debt things cannot possibly continue much longer as they are, and so they will not. Like the man in my dream emphasized to me: &quot;In two weeks my money runs out. My funding is being cut off.&quot; Of course he was right. My subconscious was only telling me what we are all realizing, many of us at the same time. It&#39;s over. The dollar is swirling around and around the worthless, fiat currency drain on its way to being an instructively admonitory, historical footnote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;2) As the Roman Catholic Pope Francis has warned in recent days, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2657724/Pope-Francis-claims-global-economy-close-collapse-describes-youth-unemployment-rates-atrocity-damning-message.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the entire global economy is on the verge of collapse&lt;/a&gt;. The whole, fraudulent edifice of private central bank, fiat currency, debt-based economics is about to come crashing down.&amp;nbsp; It is massively dysfunctional, it has plunged the vast majority of humanity into grinding poverty and it spawns endless wars. There is war after war after war, as the central bankers ceaselessly send out their proxy armies and military henchmen to exploit, plunder, invade, conquer, enslave, murder, torture, steal, etc.&amp;nbsp; Which brings me to the next point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;3) Barack Obama is even now sending USSA military personnel and major USSA military assets to the Middle East to engage the ISIS forces in Iraq and perhaps in Syria, as well. Of course there is the minor detail that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnd.com/2014/06/officials-u-s-trained-isis-at-secret-base-in-jordan/print/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2012 in Jordan the USSA military was training the very jihadi force that would two short years later become the army known as ISIS&lt;/a&gt;, but why quibble over historical fact? The main business of the USSA is war, and if people aren&#39;t fighting, or aren&#39;t fighting enough, why it is the burden of the USSA to train them to go forth and kill, the better to engender mortal conflict, so that the USSA will then need to enter the fray to fight against the very people who the USSA spent untold millions or billions of dollars arming and training to go forth and kill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;If thinking that thought makes your head hurt, think how much worse it would hurt if one of those jihadis in black drag rags turned his (surplus USSA military) assault rifle on you and blew your brains out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;4) Well, that will never happen, you say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/150-australians-hundreds-western-fighters-middle-east-official/story?id=24215115&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;because you live in Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

That will never come back on you, you say, because you are far away. You will watch it on television and read about it on the Internet.

Those are your tax dollars hard at work. Secret camps in Jordan and Turkey, international weapons trafficking, destabilization of governments on the other side of the world, CIA rendition and torture, NSA spying against &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; -- not them, and on and on the sordid mess goes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s holy hell. And it can very easily come back on you, on all of us, in many ways. And why shouldn&#39;t it, if the politicians you voted for, the military and espionage agencies of your country and the tax dollars you have paid have worked together to create ISIS and the wars in Iraq and Syria and other places? If the politicians you voted for, your tax dollars and your military are involved, by what right do you think you can merely skate above it all and just watch it on television or browse the videos on YouTube? And you personally are somehow magically not implicated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have a lot of readers in Britain.

Thousands of you did.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You see the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In fact, more and more people &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; seeing the problem and this is creating a serious crisis of so-called legitimacy for government in the USSA, Britain and elsewhere. Thinking people everywhere are questioning the role of government and their relationship to it: see &lt;a href=&quot;http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2014/06/15/the-coming-storm-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Coming Storm&lt;/a&gt; by Justin Raimondo for a hint of just some of what lies ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;5) Meanwhile, on the southern border of the USSA, a veritable flood of children and teenagers are immigrating &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt; from Central America, across Mexico, and into Texas. There has never been anything like it. There is a huge wave of them, they just keep coming, thousands upon thousands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/11/Crisis-Leaves-Border-Unprotected-Cartels-in-Control-Says-BP-Union&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Barack Obama government has decided not to enforce the borders of the USSA.&lt;/a&gt; You could make the case that a country that does not enforce its borders does not have borders, and if a country effectively has abandoned its border, is it anymore a country, a nation state, in the ordinary understanding of the term?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You tell me, because we are seeing something highly unusual.

And neither is it coincidental that more and more people are awakening to the role of the Bilderbergers behind the Anglo-USSA-ZioNazi-EU-NATO-Saudi-Qatari Axis of unspeakable evil, whence their apparent panic driven attempt to advance the level of violent chaos and global confusion to yet a more frenzied rung of mayhem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;People all over the world are asking who the hell the Bilderbergers are and by what right they presume to dictate to the rest of the world what will happen on this planet, and on whose terms?

The days of their hollow power and evil influence are numbered. The profound level of their fear can be gauged by the extreme level of secrecy with which they surround their organizational dealings, and the very high level of police repression they employ to separate themselves from the human race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Their shady ties to the various governments of this planet, and major organizations and power bases, have not gone unremarked. More and more people are noticing the individuals and governments who do the satanic bidding of the Bilderberg organization. The role of the Anglo-USSA-ZioNazi-EU-NATO-Saudi-Qatari Axis and its assorted, servile, lickspittle, obsequious little brown nosing, boot licking toadies (also known as: kings, queens, prime minsters, presidents, government ministers and secretaries) is coming into clear focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The masses of humanity are getting a very good idea of precisely who their oppressors are and precisely what the game plan is for their oppression and destruction. This is something new and the Bilderbergers are a bit uneasy. It&#39;s a new feeling for them and they don&#39;t like it. The tide has shifted just a little bit and they are not quite sure exactly what it portends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That Is Why This Moment is So Perilous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have written about the threat of nuclear war before.

To those who think that way I say: &lt;a href=&quot;http://govtslaves.info/horror-iraqi-roads-isis-death-squads-killing-without-mercy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;look at this video again&lt;/a&gt;. There are demons abroad in the world and they kill indiscriminately, without the slightest regard for anyone or anything. They chop off heads with butcher knives and drive down the highway gunning people down right and left, spraying them with automatic rifle fire and then chasing the wounded down to spray them with more bullets and finish them off. Look at reality as it is. Look at what is happening on this planet. The USSA military has trained and armed these monsters, both directly and indirectly. So don&#39;t tell me what &quot;cannot happen.&quot; It is exactly out of this shadowy underworld of the Anglo-USSA-ZioNazi-EU-NATO-Saudi-Qatari Death Axis and the vile operatives of the CIA, NSA, Mossad, MI-6 and MI-5, the French Piscine and the German BND, along with their psychopathic al-Qaeda-ISIS hell killers that the threat of nuclear false flags and other notorious crimes against humanity arises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Other shallow, silly people, who presume to know the minds and policies of extraterrestrial factions in other sectors of the galaxy, go so far as to opine that nuclear war would never happen because &quot;the aliens would prevent it.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;All I have to say is, did aliens prevent the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945? Did aliens stop WW-II and the deaths of 60 million people? Did aliens prevent the catastrophic failure of the nuclear power reactors at Fukushima, Japan which even now are poisoning the Pacific Ocean? Have aliens prevented the ongoing destruction of the Amazon forest? And so forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;This ignorant, childish silliness has to be recognized for the immature, delusional escape from reality that it is.

That the nation of Israel will even physically exist the next day? Or that the USSA-NATO-EU-ZioNazi-Saudi Axis can preemptively nuke Russia and/or China and that there can even be a liveable world in the aftermath of opening the door to the pits of hell? That the so-called USSA and EU can possibly survive the furious response that the Russians and Chinese would certainly fire back? That you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just go into your underground bunkers &lt;/a&gt;and ride it out for a few week or months?

I am not a professional seer. But it is clear to me that the events that are coming are so momentous, and will impact so many millions, and even billions of people, that they have already made a strong impression on the collective unconscious of humanity. I believe a&amp;nbsp; lot of people understand that really big events are about to unfold. They can feel them coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In my case, I simply subconsciously tuned into the probable, future reality stream that leaked over a little bit into the dreaming state while asleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That said, it does look like big events will transpire in the coming days. In fact, they&#39;ve &lt;u&gt;already&lt;/u&gt; started. Effective in recent weeks and days, the Russians unceremoniously have given the USSA dollar the heave-ho!

Look for more plunder, rape and pillage of everyone and anything, just about everywhere, for any and all reasons, or no reason at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Look for more espionage and spying on &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; and everyone you know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The USSA military and CIA are simply the &quot;enforcers&quot; for global evil incorporated, sent in to maim, torture, destroy, kill, mass murder, bomb, assassinate, steal, plunder, rape, pillage, lie, propagandize, enslave, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Some of this kind of thing was explained to me very simply almost 20 years ago by a former Royal Navy diver. He eased into the seat beside me on a long air trip. As the hours passed, we began talking about the Middle Eastern situation. He told me: &quot;Look, the Pentagon is simply a mercenary force in the pay of the big oil companies. It&#39;s a corporate, mercenary army.&quot; He also explained the British order of battle in the Falklands/&lt;i&gt;Malvinas&lt;/i&gt; war of 1982 between Argentina and Britain, if the &lt;i&gt;Malvinas&lt;/i&gt;/Falkland islands were about to fall to Argentinean control. To wit: if it appeared that the Argentinean military were going to prevail in the fight for control of the islands, the British were prepared to go to nukes, and nuke the Argentinean mainland. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I initially found what he was telling me preposterous, but he explained why. There are massive, undersea, petroleum reserves in the South Atlantic, on the South American continental shelf. The whole war was actually about business, very big business, very big petroleum business, to be precise. Those tiny islands inhabited by two thousand British sheep herders are insignificant real estate, in and of themselves. But it is what lies beneath the sea in that region of the South Atlantic, that makes them such hotly contested, geopolitical chess pieces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Of course, the British military and the Pentagon have been working hand in glove for a very long time. The same goes for the CIA and MI-6, as well as the NSA and GCHQ. The whole Anglo-American military-industrial-espionage-bankster establishment is a seamless, integral part of the deeply evil cabal that is taking down this planet and the human race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This explains the savaging and ravaging of Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, the ongoing chaos in Venezuela, the monstrous financial theft and fraud being perpetrated on all of humanity, and much more. It is a general purpose assault on the entire planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And it is accelerating in recent months, weeks and days. As the sheer evil in the cabal&#39;s dark heart grows more desperate, it will carry out ever more desperate acts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This global cabal is very heavily armed, with nuclear arms, with biological weapons that will make you bleed from every bodily orifice, with chemical arms, with nanotechnology, with electronic mind control and torture weapons, with scalar weapons, with drones, with artificially intelligent machines and computer systems, and more. The dark cabal is more than capable of unimaginable violence, up to and including genocidal violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What To Do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t cooperate!

Ecuador is a real focal point for them (as are Costa Rica, Panama and especially Venezuela these days). The country is small but important. In recent months the Ecuadorean government has ordered the USAID (known to work closely with the CIA) to wrap up its operations in Ecuador and leave the country, and has also expelled some 20 USSA military personnel from the USSA embassy in Quito.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In reality, USSA alphabet soup operatives are just about everywhere in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The former East Germany provides an illustrative example. In Communist East Germany, up to 25% of the population was at one time in the direct or indirect employ of, or at least cooperating with, the secret police in some capacity. Twenty-five years ago when I was doing my doctoral studies I was discussing this with one of my colleagues. It was our feeling, even then, that the USSA was headed in that direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As Edward Snowden has revealed, the surveillance by the USSA alphabet soup agencies is now universal. In that respect, the situation is actually worse than it was in Communist East Germany. Voluminous information is being compiled on all of us, including you, whoever you are and whatever you do, and whatever your motivation is. Do you have a Facebook account -- with photos and plenty of information about yourself, and a big list of &quot;friends&quot;, and etc.? Are you Linkdin? Do you Twitter? That all goes straight to the files of the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc. even if you are not American. If you are American they are keeping even closer watch on you. They are archiving this blog post. It&#39;s all but impossible to live a normal life and escape their clutches. That is by design. We are in a giant prison here on Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The system uses a lot of human agents, double, even triple agents. The USSA alphabet soup agencies torture, frame and kill a lot of people. I remind you that I was almost killed on 29 December 2012 here in Ecuador. I know people who believe the USSA alphabet soup agencies were behind what happened to me. I can&#39;t say one way or the other. But if they were, there would be levels of deniability, and the lower level operative(s) who handled it would certainly be here in Ecuador, doing .... well, almost anything. Could be in &quot;business&quot;, the Peace Corps, &quot;retired&quot; on the beach, a student, a &quot;tourist&quot;, a writer, a missionary, a military adviser in the USSA embassy.... you fill in the blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Secret Team&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I recommend Fletcher Prouty&#39;s classic work, &quot;The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World.&quot; The book was written in the 1970s, but everything in it remains completely relevant today. I talked with Fletcher Prouty and he revealed some interesting things. The CIA places paid agents and informants everywhere. In universities, including students and professors and staff, newspapers, TV, politics, book publishers, the military, entertainment, magazines, show business -- producers, actors, etc., Wall Street, the corporate world, religion -- Roman Catholic, Mormon, Scientology, Jewish, Muslim (who do you think al-Qaeda is?).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;When I was doing my graduate studies at major USSA universities I saw CIA recruiting posters on the departmental bulletin boards. The deal was that as of the late 1980s and early 1990s the CIA would quietly pay even an 18 year old undergraduate $33K &lt;i&gt;per annum&lt;/i&gt; to join the CIA and go to school as an ordinary student.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So I never knew which of my colleagues, which of the undergrads, which of the tenured and tenure-track faculty were CIA agents, although two of my professors self-identified as CIA contract agents. One self-identified as a double CIA-Mossad agent. A visiting, adjunct professor self-identified as a Mossad agent. A number of my fellow graduate students were USSA military intelligence officers. The rest?&amp;nbsp; When you talked with someone or socialized with someone you never knew precisely with whom you were dealing or their motivation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The whole society is like that, that&#39;s my point. The universities are simply institutional training and indoctrination centers. All of these spies matriculate in the major USSA universities and then they go forth into the world and into USSA national society, with the result that with every passing year the USSA resembles Communist East Germany more and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Only it&#39;s worse, because the technology is more sophisticated and the system is more powerful and larger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I suggest that the extremely sharp uptick in the numbers of seemingly &quot;random&quot; police killings in the USSA in recent years, may not be so &quot;random&quot; after all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I submit that targeted killing, i.e., termination with extreme prejudice of those the USSA state spy apparatus has marked for death, has already begun. By the looks of it, it may easily get worse, a lot worse, unless a lot of people get a clue and say or do something about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Fletcher Prouty&#39;s &quot;Secret Team&quot; is very much in action.

Now he is dead, but were he to update it today he could certainly include the online and offline alternative news, thought and information community in his discussion.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That is because the USSA alphabet soup agencies also have their hooks, informers and agents into the alternative news, thought and information community. The landscape is littered with &quot;ex&quot;-military and not-so-&quot;ex&quot; intelligence and other alphabet soup agency operatives and collaborators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Late night talk radio, mind expansion institutes and academies, UFOlogy, the &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; / shamanic scene, and much more. The &quot;ex&quot; and not-so-&quot;ex&quot; alphabet soup agency connections, both direct and indirect, are ubiquitous, like piles of dog shit on the sidewalk. Every time you turn around you encounter another one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Just to offer one example: before coming to South America I was not aware of the USSA Army&#39;s peripheral involvement/interest in the shamanic/&lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; scene, but I am now.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; that &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; showed me is assaulting the Earth and the human race is absolutely aware that &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; sees and understands what it is up to. And so the USSA Army to a certain degree has put its tentacles out into the Amazonian shamanic culture. It&#39;s quiet and low key, but I have certainly noticed it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I mentioned above that some of my friends have opined that one of the USSA three-letter agencies was behind what happened to me. I don&#39;t exclude the possibility, given what the shamanic plants have revealed to me and that what I write about has such clear implications for the planet-killing crimes of the corporate USSA and its satanic, three-letter agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Planet Killing, Genocidal Agenda of the Corporate USSA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The truth is that the global agenda of espionage, war, assassination, torture,&amp;nbsp; imperial conquest, environmental/ecological destruction, predatory economic enslavement, radioactive poisoning of the whole world, and debasement of the genetic code of countless biological species is at the very heart of what the corporate USSA is now doing on this world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The corporate USSA is a heartless monster in league with unthinkable evil.

It&#39;s a coordinated take down of humanity and the planet. It&#39;s a play for total domination, conquest and destruction, up to and including the extermination of most of the biological life on this planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Got Air? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The deforestation in the Amazon region alone can easily spell doom for the human race. The luxuriant vegetation in the Amazon region produces about 20% of the oxygen in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Because of the burning of fossil fuels and destruction of so much forest cover in recent years and centuries, the oxygen level of the atmosphere is far lower than it was in the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/carbonemissions.climatechange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The oxygen level is down to about 19% to 21% worldwide, and in heavily polluted cities it falls much lower, as low as 12%&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that if it gets down to around 6% or 7%, then the human race dies. We all asphyxiate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So obviously, destruction of the Amazon is a a very serious problem. Take away its 20% of global oxygen production and suddenly the atmospheric oxygen level in the large, polluted cities is down to about 9.5%, almost to the level of asphyxiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The bulldozers, chain saws, road building, slash and burn agriculture, logging, power line construction, mining, etc., all of this is going on every day. A new settlement here, a soccer field/football pitch there, a cattle pasture over yonder. Chop, chop, chop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Going, going ....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s even much worse than that, because the radioactivity from the melted down/ exploded nuclear reactors at Fukushima is pouring right&amp;nbsp; into the Pacific Ocean by the hundreds of tons every day,&amp;nbsp; and sterilizing that vast ocean. That matters hugely, because the phytoplankton in the top two or three meters of the Pacific Ocean&#39;s waters produce maybe another 25% of the oxygen in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. So as the Pacific Ocean is sterilized of life, that means that there will be less phytoplankton, and therefore reduced oxygen production, which will cause a further decline in atmospheric oxygen levels on this planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Hey, a percentage point here, a percentage point there, and suddenly, the big cities with 6 million and 10 million persons have oxygen levels of 9% or 8%, instead of 12%, and all of a sudden it&#39;s real hard to catch your breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You see, because of my blog&#39;s reader statistics, I know that I have readers in London, Tokyo, Delhi, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So the information I am giving you is not academic.

Indeed, I have already heard from another  victim of the same shaman who has nevertheless declined to pursue  justice or even to support me in my case. But unlike 99% of the others, I  have elected to stand up  and fight back, no matter the odds. And  against all expectations, my  assailant has been indicted and is going  to trial. But the battle is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I   have no illusions about what I am up against.

I&#39;ve always had plenty of dreams my whole life, but many of the recent ones have been especially thought provoking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In light of the personal ordeal I have been through over the past year and a half, the immediate inclination is to think that what I have been seeing in my dreams is merely a reflection of what is happening in my personal corner of the Universe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But I have rejected that interpretation at this pass, because many of the events that are objectively occurring&amp;nbsp; all around the planet are either without precedent, or if they do have precedent, the historical parallels are deeply alarming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;To wit: exactly one week ago, a wise, older man I seemed to know very well appeared in my dream. I pulled him aside and told him I really needed to talk to him about a seriously pressing matter. Whereupon he very soberly informed me that he had very important news for me: his funding would be cut off in two weeks, the money source would dry up in exactly two weeks. He was very emphatic about the two week period of time and the money flow stopping then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Two weeks ago from one week ago, is next weekend, the middle of June. I initially thought that probably the dream was simply my subconscious&#39; way of acknowledging that I have very little money, in light of my tremendous struggle of the last year and a half, which I have detailed in my numerous posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; over the last year or so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But then, over the last week, I started to run across more and more stories that have caused me to reconsider and posit that the interpretation of the dream really points to major, upcoming events in the world at large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I now believe that the older man in the dream actually represents the collective voice of seasoned wisdom of the collective unconscious, come to whisper in my ear a two-week warning of imminent financial turmoil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And then this morning I had another dream, in which I was again standing with a wise, older man looking on at a busy highway in the near, middle-distance. As we watched the passing cars, two vehicles suddenly, unexpectedly, collided with considerable force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;KA-WHUMP!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It was one of those deals where all of a sudden you see that the respective drivers have very badly miscalculated and set their vehicles on an unavoidable collision course. I saw what they did wrong, I saw what was about to happen, and I was completely helpless to do anything about it. It&#39;s the kind of situation where you see what is going to happen and all you can say is: &quot;Oh, &lt;u&gt;no&lt;/u&gt;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Neither the man who was with me nor I were involved in any way with what occurred.

I concur. The USSA government has put the world on a path to nuclear war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There are satanic lunatics running USSA foreign policy. Their policies seem designed to force military confrontation with China and Russia, both nuclear armed powers, with a full brace of powerful nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them on target anywhere in the world within 30 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If sanity does not prevail soon, unthinkable events with unimaginable consequences could be put into play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The problem with nuclear war is not just the initial blasts of detonating nuclear warheads and bombs. Those are more than bad enough. The terrific concussive pressure of a nuclear detonation, coupled with the tremendous heat and release of radioactivity are enormously destructive, in and of themselves, easily capable of causing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of casualties, depending on the yield of the weapon and the population density of the target area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As Steven Star has made clear in his recent article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/05/30/lethality-nuclear-weapons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Lethality of Nuclear Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, even a so-called &quot;limited&quot; nuclear war could result in up to 2 billion human casualties. A large-scale nuclear exchange would effectively be an extinction level event&amp;nbsp; for the human race and many other life forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It would not set us back to the Stone Age; it would wipe us out. It would permanently erase us from the face of the Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And that is just from consequences like fall out and nuclear winter sorts of effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Gets Even Worse -- Much, Much Worse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The problem is that not only would the massive firestorms of a shooting nuclear war produce millions of tons of smoke that would rise into the upper atmosphere; thus creating a prolonged nuclear winter that would plunge the northern hemisphere (at least) into a decade-long deep freeze that would shut down agricultural production, thus creating mass starvation --&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;No, the even more serious issue is that in that scenario most of the nuclear power plants on this world would cease to function, would melt down and/or explode and then there would be a cascading series of follow-on nuclear catastrophes that would not and could not be fixed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In effect, there would be 100 Fukushima-like nuclear power plant failures, or 200, or 300.&amp;nbsp; The hellish horror of nuclear war would be taken to an even deeper level of hell, by the follow-on failure of great numbers of nuclear power plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Game play it out. Many nuclear power plants are&amp;nbsp; near major cities and if the cities suffer nuclear strikes, then what happens to the nuclear power plants?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Answer: They fail outright, maybe in the initial nuclear blast, sending literal tons, thousands of tons, of highly poisonous nuclear fuel as a radioactive aerosol, up into the stratosphere in the towering mushroom clouds. And all of that radioactive, death dust will fall out over the face of the Earth, into the sea, into the rivers, onto the forests and farmland. Into the air you breathe, into the water you drink, into the food you eat. The deadly implications are obvious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Or, say the nuclear strikes are farther away from the nuclear power plants, but that they devastate the infrastructure of the country. Roads are impassable. Civil society, or what remains of it, is in an uproar. Lawlessness runs rampant, in the face of the collapse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Do you imagine that the technicians, engineers and maintenance staff required to run a nuclear power plant will be coming to work under those conditions? Of course not. Nothing will be working. Those who survive the initial blasts will be looking out for their own self-interest. Going to work, even assuming they are physically able to do so, will be the farthest thing from their minds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And conditions will rapidly deteriorate from there, as one nuclear power plant after another catastrophically fails. There are hundreds of them in the USSA, Europe, Ukraine, Russia, India, China and elsewhere. Something like 98% of them are in the northern hemisphere; there are only a handful in the southern hemisphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In other words, game over for humanity.Vast clouds of deadly radioactivity will sweep the face of the planet, sterilizing it of the human species and many other species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That is why nuclear war must not happen. If it does, no one will win. Everyone will lose everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That is why I have gone out on the nuclear missile silos in the USSA again and again to stage nonviolent, peace demonstrations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;For the life of me, I don&#39;t know why everyone in the world wasn&#39;t out there with me.

Indeed, I have already heard from another  victim of the same shaman who has nevertheless declined to pursue  justice or even to support me in my case. But unlike 99% of the others, I  have elected to stand up  and fight back, no matter the odds. And  against all expectations, my  assailant has been indicted and is going  to trial. But the battle is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I   have no illusions about what I am up against.

Here&#39;s a succinct &lt;span class=&quot;hw&quot;&gt;résumé&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/05/30/lethality-nuclear-weapons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the lethality of nuclear war&lt;/a&gt;. Please click the link and read it. As the linked article explains, things can quickly and easily escalate from the merely unimaginably horrific, all the way to the physical obliteration of billions of humans and many other higher life forms on this planet. Life forms like trees, ducks, cows, horses, rabbits, deer, wild flowers, roses, lilies, etc. Gone in blinding flashes and towering, billowing, mushroom clouds of highly radioactive dust that alter the Earth forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am reminded of the dark, possible future scenario that the shamanic plants called to my attention in my Amazonian shamanic excursions of mid-to-late 2012. The scenario that I was inwardly warned of is that there is a very malevolent and highly stealthy power faction on this planet who want to initiate &quot;totalitarian nuclear warfare&quot;. They contemplate achieving their objective by staging surprise, &quot;false flag&quot; atomic or nuclear attacks in cities in the USSA. Several different cities were called to my attention as their desired targets. As I understood it, they intend to use low yield devices, smaller than the bombs that the USSA dropped on Japan in 1945. Maybe in the two to ten kiloton range, enough to destroy the central business district of a city and kill a few tens of thousands of people outright. That is the plan, as I understood it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This group is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; who you would/will be told it is, if their plan is actually carried out. They are loathsome and vile, without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. An aggressively vicious, venomous serpent has better moral character than they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As I understand it, these sorts of events do &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; have to occur. The future is malleable. We &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; avoid nuclear war. It all depends on our individual and group decisions. We have to act decisively, individually and collectively, to avoid that scenario. And yet we are sliding toward nuclear war. You can see the preparations for massive nuclear war. The nuclear war exercises are announced publicly, in the daily news cycle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Then&amp;nbsp; There Is This&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The USSA military recently staged an exercise in which an adversary force tried to seize a nuclear weapon from a secure military site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Guess what?

In my repeated, nonviolent forays onto the launch lids of nuclear missile silos to peacefully demonstrate against nuclear war, I have been able to witness in person the USSA Air Force&#39;s emergency response to unexpected visitors (like me) to their nuclear missile silos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I want to tell you that they have been very lucky so far. My intent was never, and is not now, to cause a violent incident with respect to nuclear missiles. On the contrary. But others may not be so well-intentioned.&amp;nbsp; And most alarmingly (see above), when the USSA military ran a test exercise, their team lost control of the nuclear missile silo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The USSA military&#39;s nuclear policy is, thus,&amp;nbsp; reminiscent of that of a nuclear-armed, Keystone Cops global police force. It doesn&#39;t inspire much confidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As many of my readers know, I have again and again, nonviolently demonstrated against preparations for nuclear war by the USSA military.

By then it will be far too late to voice any objections, or to remonstrate, &quot;If only I had known, I would have done something, I would have said something.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Well, consider that now you do know. The world&#39;s nuclear powers are posturing for nuclear war and you are being duly informed of that reality right now. Your home planet, all of it, and your very existence are under threat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So what is your response?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Visit To Minot, North Dakota&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I went to the sprawling, nuclear missile field at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, USSA and demonstrated peacefully on a nuclear missile silo near Parshall, North Dakota on the morning of 15 April 2010. I issued my &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Minot Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; to the press on that occasion. It&#39;s one of the most important documents I have ever written, and yet, it remains one of the least read. Towards the end I explain the reasons for and symbolism of my distinctive dress and accoutrements. I took it all with me. I went over the security fence with the feather and crystal headdress, the crystal necklaces, and a bag full of conch shells, crystals and other objects which I left on the silo launch lid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qQ3I9ZaKRBs/Trs_EB4rC4I/AAAAAAAAADo/TwePa8C4GYY/s1600/Richard+Sauder+headdress+white+rose+photo.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qQ3I9ZaKRBs/Trs_EB4rC4I/AAAAAAAAADo/TwePa8C4GYY/s1600/Richard+Sauder+headdress+white+rose+photo.jpg&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The vase of three dozen white roses I left just outside the fence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The preparation for the demonstration was a long time in incubation. I spent months accumulating the feathers, crystals and ribbons for the headdress. I traveled widely, personally collecting or purchasing crystals for the necklaces that I made. I made multiple visits to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Rock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Enchanted Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the Texas Hill Country, revered for centuries by Native Americans for its special spiritual presence and power. I climbed to the top, all 400+ feet, and stood barefoot on that &lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Enchanted_Rock_Panorama_2012.jpg/3000px-Enchanted_Rock_Panorama_2012.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;huge, granite outcropping&lt;/a&gt; that wells up from the bedrock that lies deep beneath the North American Continent. I faced the north, toward North Dakota, and expressed my intent to the continent itself and asked its blessing. I spoke to the Nature spirits that were there and asked them to go with me on my journey. I could feel their presence; it was palpable. I had a strong sense of connection with the massively alive and conscious, spiritual essence of the continent itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I also paid multiple visits to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec_Mounds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toltec Mounds&lt;/a&gt; in central Arkansas, to ask the blessing of the spirits of the ancient shamans and ancestors who reside there. The first time I went, Walela&#39;s flesh-tingling, Cherokee rendering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkpYgvIBtU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/a&gt; was playing in the visitor&#39;s center. I went out directly and crossed the field to visit with the tree right&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goldposters.com/posterimages/4240626-high-platform-mound-of-the-plum-bayou-people-toltec-mounds-archaeological-state-park-arkansas.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; in the middle of this photo&lt;/a&gt;. As I say, I went to the Toltec Mounds more than once, and as at Enchanted Rock in central Texas, the silent solitude of the place is very conducive to forging a deep connection with the land and the resident spirits, if that is what you want. It was my impression that the spirits were curious, and a bit surprised, since almost no one bothers to communicate with them and ask their blessing, especially on such a cold and blustery day as the first time I visited, with a bitterly icy wind cutting in off of Mound Lake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Understand that when I talk about the spirits here I am not talking about the nonsense that passes for &quot;spirituality&quot; in so many Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Muslim mosques and Hindu temples. Nor am I referring in any way to their so-called religious &quot;morality&quot;. I am rather talking about conscious communication with the multidimensional, conscious Nature spirits who inhabit the hyper-aware, living landscape, an altogether different thing.&amp;nbsp; For some reason, on most of the occasions that I visited both Enchanted Rock and the Toltec Mounds there were very few people there. Both places were usually almost deserted, which was to my liking, given that I came to consult with the resident natural spirits of those hallowed precincts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Are In The Fight Of Our Lives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We have to reestablish conscious communication with the Earth itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How many rounds of ammo you may have are simply &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;relevant&lt;/u&gt;, or how much food you have stored, if the Earth itself dies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And right now, the Earth is dying, it is reeling, it is under heavy assault.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Let us count the ways: fracking, deforestation, Fukushima&#39;s radioactive murder of the Pacific Ocean, genetic modification of the DNA of evermore species of life, global chemical contamination of the environment, chemtrails, nanotechnology, global predatory economics, obvious preparation for possible extinction level, nuclear warfare, overfishing of the seas and oceans, the ongoing death of the Gulf of Mexico due to British Petroleum&#39;s savage crimes against man and Nature, the destruction of the Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And that is just a very partial list off the top of my head.

These installations can be literally anywhere -- beneath the sea, beneath the mountains or a desert, swamp or large city. And they can be very deep, thousands of feet down, a mile or more, as well as impressively large and technologically sophisticated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/prodimages/Underground%20Bases-Tunnels.jpg&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I still remember when I was beginning my research. I couldn&#39;t believe the sorts of documents that I found in the open literature, including the material from the US National Committee on Tunneling Technology for making &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tunnels hundreds of miles long&lt;/a&gt;, and the plans for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subterrene, the nuclear powered tunnel boring machine&lt;/a&gt; that was in R&amp;amp;D at Los Alamos National Laboratory, designed to melt its way through solid rock, like a hot knife through butter, and much more. There were even references to a Subselene, intended to melt tunnels on the Moon. It was then, and remains still, very strange. All sorts of people, from all walks of life, began funneling bits and pieces of information to me. It is a fact that this &quot;hidden&quot; underground and undersea reality is so extensive that it simply cannot be kept totally secret. It turned out that one of my friends (now deceased) was taken by the Secret Service deep underground beneath the White House in Washington, D.C. This was back during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, in the 1960s, when she was working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in an entry level position. She never understood why the incident occurred, and the Secret Service offered no explanation. They simply showed up at her desk one day, escorted her across town to the White House, ushered her into an elevator and took her down 17 levels underground into a secret network of hallways, corridors and offices to deliver some papers she had been given &lt;u&gt;by&lt;/u&gt; the Secret Service.&amp;nbsp; She went to her grave without knowing the who, what and why of that incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It is very puzzling, but then I have run across a whole slew of puzzling stories when researching and writing about the mysterious deep underground and undersea bases and tunnels. Something highly strange is going on and we have not been told even a tenth of one percent about it. One of the things that became clear to me is that the entrances to these subterranean and sub-sea facilities can be literally anywhere -- on a secure military base, beneath an office building or government building, university, church, or school,&amp;nbsp; beneath a dilapidated farm building or farm silo, inside a house or ordinary looking outbuilding, warehouse or factory. At a rock quarry or heavy construction site, inside a road, subway or railway tunnel. Or maybe a doorway set in a cliff face on a mountainside or inside a storm sewer, strip mine, deep mine or hydroelectric dam. It is all cleverly hidden all around us. We are living in bizarro world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UUB&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/prodimages/Underwater-Underground%20Bases.jpg&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I continued my research in &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UUB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Underwater and Underground Bases&lt;/a&gt;. I kept finding more material, so I kept going. It became clear to me, as I came across more material, that the USSA military and others have also been busy undersea. Already, as of the mid-1960s (if not before), the technology, expertise and funding was available to make large, undersea bases, hundreds of miles out to sea, in mid-ocean. The offshore, continental shelves are an even easier area to tunnel out and construct undersea bases. The documentation and illustrations that I obtained clearly mentioned berthing large, military submarines and their crews in sub-sea bases tunneled out of the seafloor. The USSA Navy documents referred to this as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UUB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rock Site plan&lt;/a&gt;. Based on what I have been told by a number of different people,&amp;nbsp; something like this has been done, but under a different name that remains unknown to me, as of this writing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The important thing to understand is that this project of underground and underwater base and tunnel construction, that is ongoing to the present day, has a long genesis, going back at least to the Third Reich, in its present manifestation. As I continued my research I ran across some old &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Project Paperclip memos from 1947&lt;/a&gt; that explicitly mentioned bringing&amp;nbsp; Xaver Dorsch and some other Nazi underground base experts to the USSA, to work on the USSA military&#39;s so-called &quot;underground plant program&quot;. I reproduce these memoranda in my book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files&lt;/a&gt;. Xaver Dorsch, of course, was the head of the Todt Organization, from 1942 to the end of WW-II. The Todt Organization was a civil engineering agency that was analogous in the Nazi military system to the US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Navy Seabees, in the American military system, albeit that the Todt Organization was not itself a military agency. Fritz Todt, the father of the world famous German &lt;i&gt;Autobahn&lt;/i&gt; system, was the head of the organization, up until his death in an airplane crash in 1942, whereupon effective control became consolidated in Xaver Dorsch&#39;s hands. Dorsch initially reported to Albert Speer, but in 1944 Adolf Hitler ordered Dorsch to report directly to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Sauder_Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_cover-175pixel.jpg&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;At war&#39;s end Xaver Dorsch was probably the preeminent expert in the world on the construction of large, elaborate, underground bases and tunnel systems. The Nazis were far ahead of the Americans in that field, as in aviation, rocketry, chemical engineering and other fields.&amp;nbsp; Dorsch was in USSA military custody for a period of years after war&#39;s end. I obtained a couple of the documents he wrote during his debriefing by the USSA Army.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In any event, the documentary trail I found indicates that part of Project Paperclip was definitely concerned with underground base construction. Public&amp;nbsp; remarks in 1987 by Lloyd Duscha, then &lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;Deputy&lt;/span&gt; Director of Engineering and Construction for the &lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, make clear that the USSA program of underground base construction was given its impetus by the Nazi program. This is an explicit corroboration of the plain evidence in the 1947 Project Paperclip memoranda.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;One of the other things that became real clear to me as I further pursued my research and writing was that the most serious action in Washington, DC takes place underground, in some cases, extremely deep underground. I ran across documentation from the last days of the JFK administration, in early November 1963, for a planned, very deep, manned command center far beneath Washington, DC, from which to wage and survive nuclear war. The plans mentioned a depth of 3,500 feet, with secure access from the White House, State Department and Pentagon, by multiple, deep elevators and underground trains. The facility was referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DUCC&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after these secret plans began circulating at the highest levels of the JFK administration, he was assassinated in Dallas. I have no idea what his position was on the matter, but the plans continued to circulate at the highest levels of the government in the early weeks and months of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;Everything that I have seen and heard points to the implementation of those plans, and on a large scale. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight&lt;/a&gt; I provide further documentation that goes to the updating and enlarging of the subterranean network beneath Washington, D.C. I used to live and work as a residential window cleaner in the Washington, D.C. area, but after a couple of years, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The negative atmosphere of the place was detrimental to my health, so I moved far away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planned Nuclear War&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Paul Craig Roberts&lt;/a&gt; has written repeatedly in recent weeks and months about the growing danger of a shooting nuclear war, likely initiated by dark, power mad factions within the USSA power structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;If you have read this far, you will have realized that I agree with his assessment. Nuclear war is a real possibility, and if the USSA continues on its power mad, imperialistic project of world hegemony, come hell or high water, then nuclear war is probably all but inevitable. Past a certain point, other nuclear armed nations will probably fight back. Those other powers would plausibly include, but not necessarily be limited to, Russia and China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;There is profound wickedness in, and deep below, Washington, D.C. I mean that the place seethes with an odious, satanic atmosphere. Terrible evil has taken root there. It is perhaps the darkest center of evil-doing in the world, with the Vatican, Wall Street, the City of London and Tel Aviv-Herzliya following very hard on its heels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;My research plainly shows that preparation for nuclear war is one of the major impetuses in the decades-long underground and underwater tunnel and base construction program. For example, the idea of putting nuclear missile silos in the seafloor popped up repeatedly in he materials that I consulted. My guess is that this has been done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;The logical conclusion is that the USSA power structure has embarked on a massive, nuclear war preparation project. It is beyond insane. It is impossible to wrap your head around it. The implications are hideous beyond comprehension. And yet there is a lot of evidence pointing in that direction, some of which I have discussed in this article.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refName&quot;&gt;In the early 1960s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.democraticunderground.com/Time%20for%20change/483&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USSA military tried repeatedly to get President Kennedy to launch a first-strike nuclear attack against the USSR&lt;/a&gt;. Estimates for casualties were 140 million in the USSR and anywhere from 30 to 50 million in the USSA. The population today is far larger than it was half a century ago, so the casualties would undoubtedly be much higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The very idea is insanity, by any measure. And yet, here we are, more than 50 years later, with the foreign policy of the USSA steadily driving the world towards a catastrophic war that could easily go nuclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am telling you, there are demons in human form in Washington, DC.

Most of my readers are in the USSA and the Eurozone,&amp;nbsp; but none of you who reside in the USSA or Europe should be under any illusions. The ostensibly freest societies in recorded history, the so-called &quot;western democracies&quot;,&amp;nbsp; are in reality extremely controlled and highly surveilled societies. Indeed, Edward Snowden, the ex-USSA intelligence operative now living in exile in Russia, recently revealed that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NSA spies more on Americans than it does on Russians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This is another way of saying that the USSA is a giant, red-white-and-blue, federal prison. The same goes for those of you in the European Union. You&#39;re an inmate, slave labor, an economic unit of production or consumption, a duly tagged, numbered, coded and registered piece of state property. So your whole life you are herded, tracked, monitored, observed and, if necessary, you are culled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Culled, as in killed, taken out, terminated with extreme prejudice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Kill People Based On Metadata&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s happening every day. The Internet is full of videos and stories of these lynchings by the government in the USSA. We need to screw our game face on and soberly face what is going on. We need to unflinchingly look at the truth and acknowledge what is happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In a recent public debate, former NSA and CIA Director, Michael Hayden, plainly stated: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rt.com/usa/158460-cia-director-metadata-kill-people/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We kill people based on metadata.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; He quickly qualified his statement by saying that the NSA doesn&#39;t do that using &quot;this metadata,&quot; without however explicitly clarifying exactly to which metadata he was referring. But why should we accept an ambiguous qualification from a man who has just publicly confessed to personal involvement in a vast, ongoing, serial murder operation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So let&#39;s take his open assertion deathly serious, and regard Michael Hayden as an extraordinarily vicious and dangerous being on the loose, because this &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; a life and death matter of the utmost gravity. Now that we have a public statement from a former director of the NSA and the CIA that the USSA alphabet soup agencies do in fact kill people based on surveillance metadata, and recent revelations from Edward Snowden that the USSA alphabet soup agencies are collecting voluminous amounts of metadata about &lt;u&gt;us&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt;, about me, and about every single person reading this article, isn&#39;t it time we begin to view the accelerating spate of vicious police murders of civilians in the USSA in a more sober light?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Could It Be Any Plainer? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We&amp;nbsp; have the forthright admission that they kill people based on surveillance metadata.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We have the revelations from Edward Snowden that metadata is being collected on everyone, everywhere, all the time, and that the surveillance is concentrated on people in the USSA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And we have the police all across the USSA blowing people away right and left with no warrant, no arrest, no testimony, no arraignment, no trial. They are just taking people out, gunning them down in the street, in their homes, on the sidewalk, anywhere and everywhere. There are so many of these police lynchings that you can spend literal hours watching these violent police &quot;snuff videos&quot; on YouTube and other video websites. And those are just the ones that somehow make it onto the Internet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How hard is it to connect those dots?

I was further shown that the dictatorial system would have a sort of overhead control grid that would be very much like a net, or a shimmering, ethereal, mesh-like structure hovering in the air. It would be electronic in nature, but also with an optically invisible, quasi-spiritual side, such that human thought, behavior and even spirituality would be suppressed and controlled. It is designed to dampen and suppress human freedom and liberty, not only physically but also spiritually, to corral humanity into a global,&amp;nbsp; oppressive, full spectrum, totalitarian, prison camp. Earth as a planet-wide, full spectrum, totalitarian concentration camp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Prison planet Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s being set up right now. That is the plan. I&#39;ve seen it and it is grim. I was shown it very clearly, like seeing it on a flat panel television screen, or computer monitor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The global NSA surveillance that Edward Snowden has revealed is part of that. The global network of spy satellites is part of that. The proliferation of surveillance drones is part of that. The global, imperial warfare of the USSA is part of that. You see the point. The intended trajectory of world events is as transparent as a pane of glass for those who care to see it for what it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;From what I have been shown, the agenda goes far beyond what the average person expects or envisions. We need to &quot;up&quot; our game dramatically. And I am &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; talking about relying on fundamentalist Christianity or fundamentalist Islam or Judaism.. Completely to the contrary. Some of the most pathetically mind-controlled people on this planet can be found crowding into the churches, mosques and synagogues of the so-called Abrahamic religions, the monotheistic religions, the people of the &quot;book&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In large part, Christianity, Islam and Judaism are ancient, mind-control mechanisms. Look at the unspeakable, satanic depravity and ignorance of Muslim Shariah law, look at the hideous lies and genocide the Jews are perpetrating against the Palestinians, look at the incredibly violent, ghastly history of the Roman Catholic church. And these are the people, be they Jew, Christian or Muslim, who feel qualified to preach to the rest of the world about spirituality and morality?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;No, what I am talking about is outside of and above any of these transparently ignorant, savagely violent, religious traditions that have caused so much harm to so many millions of people. In fact, the global dictatorship &lt;u&gt;uses&lt;/u&gt; ignorant, violent, &quot;religious&quot; individuals to carry out its dirty work, its murder, its torture, its kidnapping, its imprisoning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Generation Drones?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;What I was shown in my visions includes what we physically see around us in our daily life, and another, more subtle, quasi-invisible level of technology. Sometimes you see it, sometimes you don&#39;t or can&#39;t. It is a real technology, but for many people it is harder to perceive and grasp mentally. And for that reason, it presents yet another level of challenge, a greater degree of difficulty to come to terms with. But its impact on humanity is profound. It locks us in a jail with invisible bars, mental bars, spiritual bars, subtle energy bars. Do you grasp what I am saying? You cannot &quot;see&quot; radio waves, and yet they are real, and have a real impact on humanity. The influence on humanity of radio technology, for better or for worse, has been enormous over the past century. What I am describing to you is also a technology, a subtle technology, true enough, but real nonetheless, and its impact on humanity also is profound, profoundly negative and profoundly oppressive, almost beyond the power of words to describe. What you do not see, and little suspect, can hurt you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In recent years, there has been a great deal of discussion in certain corners of the Internet and on late-night talk radio, at least in the USSA, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=2201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a puzzling new class of aerial machines&lt;/a&gt; that author, blogger and investigator Linda Moulton Howe has referred to as dragonfly drones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Many people have been quick to decry &lt;a href=&quot;http://truthfall.com/weird-dragonfly-aerial-drones-the-chad-photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the stories and photos of the strange aerial machines&lt;/a&gt;, but not me. I have seen far too many strange objects in the skies over the years, in different times and places, under a variety of circumstances, to jump to an ill-considered conclusion. On the contrary, I believe that we may just be looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://truthfall.com/investigation-caret-dragonfly-drones-isaac-material/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an intermediate level of surveillance and control technology&lt;/a&gt;, that straddles the twilight zone borderland between our everyday 3-D world and the meta-level of &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s dark sub-domain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I regard the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_flyingobjects11.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Isaac&quot; character and his story of the CARET, reverse engineering program in Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt; as a misinformation and disinformation gambit on the part of the shadowy controllers, whoever or whatever they are, and wherever they may be, in order to establish some semblance of damage control over unwanted attention to the unplanned public disclosure of some of their secret surveillance and control technology. Or is the ostensibly &quot;accidental&quot; public disclosure both planned and wanted? In any event, the &quot;Isaac&quot; story is most likely disinformation in the classic sense, in that much of what has been revealed will be true or at least partially so, but will also include important elements of falsehood, in order to obscure more important truths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Or could it be that the USSA alphabet soup agencies are actually not involved, or at least not in the way that &quot;Isaac&quot; has conveyed, but that they would like people to believe they are?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Be that as it may, the elements of the story that are probably true, in my estimation, are that there was a compartmentalized, clandestine program in Palo Alto, California ... or somewhere. It may well have been housed in an ordinary looking office building that concealed multiple, secret underground levels. It may well have entailed reverse engineering highly exotic, sophisticated technology. The technology may even be &quot;extraterrestrial&quot;, in the strict sense of originating on another planet. Or that could be a falsehood, too. It may or may not be non-human technology in its inception.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking It To A Mental Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Some of the best remote viewers are uncannily good. The alleged site of the CARET project was very close to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park; so close in fact, that I wonder if SRI was not involved. I say that because SRI has for decades worked on a wide variety of classified projects for the military-industrial-espionage complex. Indeed, in the years just before the alleged CARET &quot;dragonfly drone&quot; project, SRI was deeply involved in developing the USSA&#39;s alphabet soup agency remote viewing capability. To me, it would be a no brainer that the remote viewers would have been brought in on the CARET project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Either the remote viewers saw this technology in their remote viewing, where it was and what its capabilities were, or they would have been brought in to remote view it after its discovery. As for where it may have been found -- maybe on the Moon or Mars? Or maybe it was excavated right here on Earth. Who knows what the USSA&#39;s military-industrial-espionage complex&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decades-long program of tunnel boring and secret underground and undersea base excavation&lt;/a&gt; may have discovered deep underground or undersea. Who knows what might have been discovered and brought back from an ancient cavern or tunnel beneath the Giza plateau in Egypt? Or from a Babylonian zigurrat? Or from a Mayan pyramid in Mexico?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The High Strangeness Factor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The Caret, dragonfly drones bring something to mind for me that I cannot quite articulate. I had an extremely strong sense of &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;déjà&lt;/span&gt; vu&lt;/i&gt; as I wrote certain parts of this blog posting.

Sometimes they are pages on obscure websites. Occasionally they are pages on USSA government websites. They routinely contain thousands or tens of thousands of &quot;words&quot; and may even contain as many as a quarter of a million, or more,&amp;nbsp; different words, names, technical terms and combinations of letters and numbers, in a variety of languages. Are they a linguistic tool that the alphabet soup agencies use for programming reality?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Something Very Strange Is Going On&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;A monstrous reality has been unleashed on this planet.

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nazi Vril flying saucers that are in the custody of the heavily compartmentalized, alphabet-soup agencies at Area 51&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot; style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I do not doubt the story. The research and writing of author, Joseph Farrell,&amp;nbsp; has amply demonstrated in recent years that the Nazis were working on engineering the vacuum and apparently succeeded in making major engineering and scientific breakthroughs. Dr. Farrell has published prolifically, so if you will do an online search on his name you will easily access his work. Read his stuff. Buy his books, or borrow them from a&amp;nbsp; lending library. You&#39;ll learn something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;My own research has also revealed the extent to which the present system in the USSA, and in a good number of other countries, is in reality a hybrid Nazi system. World War II did not end as we have been told, not by a long shot. We have been massively lied to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I remember when I first saw John G. Fuller&#39;s book, &lt;i&gt;The Interrupted Journey - Two Lost Hours Aboard a Flying Saucer,&lt;/i&gt; about the Betty and Barney Hill UFO abduction in 1963. The book came out in 1966 and my father purchased a copy and read it. We lived in Virginia and there were some spectacular UFO sightings in Virginia in the 1950s and 1960s. I was just a kid at the time, but I remember picking John Fuller&#39;s book up, reading through it and being mystified by what happened to the Hills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;To this day, I keep coming back to what Barney Hill said under hypnosis when he was describing his encounter with the beings in the flying saucer. Speaking of the captain of the UFO, he said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“He looks like a German Nazi. He&#39;s a Nazi ...”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And maybe the captain of the flying saucer &lt;u&gt;was&lt;/u&gt; a Nazi officer. It was only 18 years after World War II, and Project Paperclip, the clandestine, American alphabet-soup program that brought large numbers of &quot;ex&quot;-Nazi military officers, scientists, engineers and technicians, along with entire trainloads of captured German technology and blueprints to the USSA, was a vast project that cast a very wide and very secret net.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I presume that&amp;nbsp; Nazi flying saucer technology absolutely was included in Project Paperclip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In about 1989 or 1990 I met Madeleine Rodeffer, a resident of Silver Spring Maryland. Ms. Rodeffer was a friend of the famous UFO contactee, George Adamski, who had multiple sightings of and visitations by Vril-style flying saucers and their crews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Anyway, Ms. Rodeffer filmed a Vril-style flying saucer that visited her home in Silver Spring, Maryland. George Adamski had alerted her to the possibility of its visit and she was ready, camera in hand, when it appeared. It hovered near her house for 10 minutes. You can read a little about it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;amp;dat=19680522&amp;amp;id=gIY1AAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=TqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=1013,5767476&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an interview she gave to the Montreal Gazette on 22 May 1968&lt;/a&gt; (use the little hand to maneuver around on the page and read the story). The interview is on page 70, along with a small picture of the flying saucer. It is a classic Nazi Vril-type saucer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/EttKw7ROGN8&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I watched her film, part of which is visible in this YouTube clip and was persuaded of its genuineness. Remember, this was decades ago, when the cameras were analog, and used real film. There was no possibility of CGI fakery. This is a vintage, 8 millimeter film clip from 1968. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Bob Oechsler, physicist and former NASA mission specialist examined the film and concluded that it is genuine. He is technically competent and more qualified than most to evaluate its validity. His comments about a force field around the craft jibe very well with my own feeling and observation when I viewed the film clip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;After I viewed her short film I asked Ms. Rodeffer if she saw anything through the portholes. She said, yes, that young Caucasian men, with short, military-style crew cuts had come to the windows and looked out at her as the flying saucer hovered near her home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I found Ms. Rodeffer to be very personable and credible. In my opinion, this was probably a Vril flying saucer, operated either by a Project Paperclip Nazi crew or an American military crew. The craft may be of German manufacture or USSA&amp;nbsp; alphabet-soup agency, clandestine, compartmentalized project manufacture.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea if its design is extraterrestrial. It may still be in use. That is my view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Gets More Zany&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;As I began my research into secret underground bases in the early 1990s, one of the first USSA military documents that my archival investigations brought to light mentioned plans to carry out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventuresunlimitedpress.com/proddetail.php?prod=UGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very deep excavation beneath the Zanesville, Ohio area&lt;/a&gt; (and in many other places, too). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I found this interesting, because in my personal UFOlogical research I had stumbled across the pioneering work of&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/supressed_inventions/suppressed_inventions25.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T. Townsend Brown, an electrical engineering genius&lt;/a&gt; who lived and worked in Zanesville, Ohio. Brown&#39;s pioneering work had to do with the link between gravity and electrical fields, or maybe I should say, the link between &quot;anti&quot;-gravity and electrical fields. He began his work in the 1920s and continued right through into the post-WW II period. &lt;a href=&quot;http://projetmontgolfier.info/PHOTOGRAPHS.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In 1955 and 1956 he worked on an R&amp;amp;D program in France&lt;/a&gt; that frankly involved testing a rudimentary flying saucer design. Though his research showed promise, it was completely shut down by the French, at least outwardly. I agree with Tom Valone and Paul LaViolette that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/supressed_inventions/suppressed_inventions25.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T. Townsend Brown&#39;s work was likely co-opted by the USSA military-industrial complex&lt;/a&gt; and taken Deep Black into the world of very clandestine, compartmentalized R&amp;amp;D work of the most sensitive kind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Here is my best understanding of what happened and what is going on now, based on a variety of archival evidence I have seen, soft information and private conversations I have had. During my extensive archival research on underground bases, I went back to the WW-II period and meticulously combed through the technical, scientific and engineering literature for the USSA military agencies, NACA and NASA, and the corporate engineering literature, from about 1940 up to 1990, or so. In the open literature I ran across a number of papers and documents having to do with antigravity and electrogravtics and could not help but notice that it all started to peter out  in the mid- to late 1950s, and then dwindled away to almost nothing, in the open technical literature of that era.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In my estimation, the 1950s were when the big breakthroughs started to be made and the whole thing was taken into highly secretive, hermetically compartmentalized R&amp;amp;D programs. I would guess that manned space flights were made, starting already in the early 1950s, based on a combination of T. Townsend Brown&#39;s work (probably unbeknownst to him) and other, exotic technology obtained from the Nazis under Project Paperclip, and that the public, manned space programs using chemical rocket technology were continued as a propaganda cover that concealed the highly classified, non-chemical rocket space programs. At a bare minimum, I surmise that the Germans, Russians, French and the USSA have been involved in this parallel research and development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I would expect that Siemens is into antigravity and electrogravitics up to its eyeballs. The same would have gone for Aérospatiale, the former French aerospace conglomerate, which was broken up and folded into the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, which just this year became the Airbus Group, a multinational, aerospace conglomerate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;From what I have seen, you can throw an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; working group of the major USSA aerospace companies of the post-WW II period into the stew:&amp;nbsp; Boeing, Lockheed, Martin, Fairchild, Bell, Convair,&amp;nbsp; McDonnell Douglas, Northrop, Grumman, etc. have likely been involved in highly secret development of antigravitics and antigravity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;None of this can be documented with an archival paper trail, because it has all been taken deeply secret and is highly compartmentalized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;What we do know is that literally multiple &lt;u&gt;trillions&lt;/u&gt; of dollars have gone missing from the Pentagon&#39;s books alone, in the last couple of decades. That money is being siphoned off by the TRAIN LOADS to secret projects. My research shows two prime candidates: 1) secret space programs and 2) &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret underground and underwater bases and tunnels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Given the amount of disappearing money, we are obviously talking about &lt;u&gt;very&lt;/u&gt; large scale projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And the great masses of the world&#39;s people are completely oblivious to what is going on, because they have been systematically lied to about it all, for over half a century.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;My archival research, private conversations and soft information suggest to me that there are probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;underwater bases off of the USSA on both continental shelves, in the Channel Island region in coastal California waters and off the coast of Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, also in the waters around Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and under Lake Ontario, in the Great Lakes region of North America. The New England Sea Mounts in the North Atlantic, Hawaii, the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea are other prime regions for undersea bases and undersea tunnels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;What is in the bases? Based on the sum total of all I have read and been told, some highly unusual activities are taking place. The most mundane would be clandestine mining for valuable minerals such as gold, platinum, uranium, diamonds, etc. There are also likely to be secret nuclear missile silos embedded in the ocean floor --&amp;nbsp; silos made of special structural glass, because at great ocean depth glass is twenty times stronger than structural steel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I fully expect that there are special, highly secure, alien-human interaction zones in ultra-secret undersea bases, and also in super-secret underground bases. And no, not at Dulce, New Mexico, which is an extensive, disinformation gambit. Why? --&amp;nbsp; because if everyone is looking at Dulce, where there is nothing, then that leaves nobody to look at other places, where they might actually see something and find something out. It is simple misdirection, the same thing that a stage magician does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;By the way, based on my research I also believe there are very possibly subsurface, clandestine bases on the Moon and Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And yes, we really are dealing with a kind of &quot;black magic&quot; that makes abundant use of massive lies, mind-boggling levels of deceit and industrial scale misdirection. Focus your mind on the fact that literal trillions of dollars are being sucked out of the global economy and we know nothing about where the money is going and what is being done with it. By comparison, the work of a Las Vegas stage magician who makes an elephant disappear from his audience&#39;s view is mere child&#39;s play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enter The Machine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s all part of the work of &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;, which I have written about before on this blog. It uses anyone and anything to carry out its agenda -- political parties, national governments, military institutions, Black Budget clandestine projects, spy agencies, institutional religion, organized crime, major universities, large corporations, and and all willing individuals, and any and all available technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I first became aware of &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; through &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; visions in late 2010. &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; understands humanity inside and out. It plays the human race like a fiddle, to humanity&#39;s great detriment, because &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; is heartless, cruel, pitiless, relentless, calculating, cold, devious, soulless and absolutely without remorse. It is bent on total subjugation, complete domination and even outright annihilation of humanity and the Earth itself. It operates in the 3-D physical realm and also in the near spiritual, so-called &quot;astral&quot; realm of our Earth realities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The merry go round in  the Dwight Yoakam video below captures very well some of the sorts of visual  effects you may experience when you view certain aspects of &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; in the astral realm. It is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;  a carnival merry go round, but the videographer has nevertheless  managed to capture or reflect a few essential elements of it in his  visual depiction of the&amp;nbsp; merry go round -- the colors, the light bulbs  in the ceiling and around the mirrors, the dream-like, quasi-magical surreality of it, the  lifeless semblance of the horses -- all are evocative of the vivid  impression that &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; makes when you examine it at close range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;When you realize what it is up to you just want to stop it and get off and get away from it. You just want the insanity to end. The thought that came to my mind was: &quot;Are you f***ing kidding me ?!?&quot; It was surreal, bizarre beyond the power of words to describe, that this &lt;i&gt;Machine&lt;/i&gt; is methodically taking the world and the human race down, and not one person in one thousand seems to have the slightest clue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/0oFdFdcXKb4&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Once you become aware of its activities you see it in operation all over the world -- in predatory economics, in unending warfare and threats of warfare, in rampant environmental destruction, in deforestation, chemical contamination, chemtrail spraying, nanotechnology, genetic engineering and genetic modification, in rampant spying by the NSA and CIA, in narcotics trafficking and human trafficking, in the nuclear crisis at Fukushima, and much more. &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; has millions of people who kill for it, enslave people for it, destroy the environment for it, spy for it, contaminate the Earth for it, develop destructive technologies for it, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It gives its collaborators whatever they want -- money, status, power, protection, immunity from consequences, anything. And then, when their usefulness is over, it may have another minor cog of &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; take them out in a back alley and slit their throat -- or maybe throw them off the roof of a tall building, witness the recent spate of alleged banker &quot;suicides&quot;, wherein said bankers are alleged to fling themselves to their deaths from high buildings. Why is this done? Because if a cog gets to know too much about &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s agenda then that cog becomes expendable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The forces of darkness are, well, you know, very &lt;u&gt;dark&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Everything I can see points to a very destructive agenda for the Earth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Want a nice retirement house in the foothills of the Rockies? Or in upstate New York? Hey, you  can have it!! All you have to do is design nuclear missiles for  Lockheed-Martin and &lt;i&gt;The Machine &lt;/i&gt;will see to it that you  are well taken care of in your golden years. It has operators everywhere, standing by to take  its siren call and do its deadly bidding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Priceless Garden of Earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Most people have yet to tumble to the idea that the Garden of Eden is Earth itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;My understanding is that the Earth was established a very, very long time ago as a living, biological, genetic, library, a priceless DNA treasure trove of unrivaled richness and diversity, an ecological treasure of unsurpassed value, not only in this galaxy, but in the Universe as a whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Earth is a stupendous ecological marvel without equal anywhere throughout the ages.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;And nowhere on this jewel of a plant is there more biodiversity than in tropical South America in general, in the Amazon region in particular, and most especially in eastern Ecuador, the place where I was assaulted and almost killed on 29 December 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;What happens on this planet matters a great deal.

That&#39;s the only way I know to proceed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;What happens in the Amazon is vitally important  to what happens on this planet. The shamans of the region theoretically  have an essential role to play in healing the Amazon and showing the way  for humanity to deeply bond with the natural world -- but not if they themselves are abusive to the very people who come to the region to consult the sacred  power plants in search of hyper-conscious communion with Mother Nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;And  so I need your assistance.

I happened to be in Hollywood, just off of Hollywood Boulevard, and crossed paths with a guy who had one. He told me a little about it, that it had been developed by the Russians for use in their space capsules on long-duration flights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In space, if there is a medical emergency or serious medical issue there are no hospitals or emergency rooms. So the cosmonauts and astronauts must deal themselves with whatever medical situation arises in orbit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/y8je9lEnrUY&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;This video by Dr. Irina Kossovskaia explains the basics of the Scenar&#39;s mode of operation. It essentially reads the body&#39;s energy flow, determines what is awry or out of kilter, and then makes an adjustment to the nerve impulses to bring the body back into balance. It is harmonious, non-intrusive and eminently healing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You would think that every hospital and medical clinic on the face of the Earth would be using Scenars in their treatment protocols, but you would be wrong. It cannot be the expense of the Scenar unit itself, because Scenars cost a great deal less than many (alleged) therapeutic modalities now in use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But the very effectiveness of the Scenar could provide an important clue as to why it is so slow to be adopted outside of Russia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scenar.lv/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PDFBasicScenarOverview.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impressive list of maladies, symptoms, syndromes and diseases&lt;/a&gt; that the Scenar has had remarkable success in treating. Considering the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry alone, you can see how the major drug manufacturers would be profoundly threatened by a simple, highly effective, relatively low cost healing device with an impressive ability to eliminate or reduce pain, and other symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Just think how that might cut into tranquilizer profits. Then, too, if people are healthier they don&#39;t require as many surgical operations, so that could really knock the bottom out of the medical slice-and-dice business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I knew a woman who had to have her gall bladder removed. It took less than an hour. The surgeon went in with a tube and a light and snipped it out in no time. She had to pay the hospital $15,000 for that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;You can see the problem. If the guys who are making $15,000 per operation are suddenly faced with a drop in business, because people are having their bodies put back in balance with the Scenar -- well, they might no longer be making $50,000 per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I have been trying to get Scenar treatments here in Ecuador, with no luck so far. I hope to remedy that situation before too much longer, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The Scenar has obvious benefits for someone like me, with lingering damage to my nerves and associated issues in my musculoskeletal system. This is what the Scenar excels in, regulating and normalizing the transmission of the nerve signals, reducing pain and inflammation, inducing a state of well-being, or of better being, at any rate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;After months of hospitalization in the public hospitals here in Ecuador, with long periods of serious pain and suffering, and watching days and weeks of the suffering and death of other men,&amp;nbsp; I have been wondering why these devices are not universally adopted and used by the medical and physical therapy professions all over the world. It is not the expense -- the drugs, operations and machines already in use cost vastly more -- and much of the time are far less effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Indeed, a lot of the drugs given to patients in hospitals have very negative side effects, that can often be fatal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, there is a sort of profound ignorance, arrogance and resistance to change and new ways of thinking and treating disease that infects much of the medical guild. Many physicians and hospitals still have a 19th century mentality and countless millions of people suffer and die unnecessarily because of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;If I had the money, I would mount a serious campaign to introduce the Scenar to the public hospital system, physical therapy clinics and community health centers all across Ecuador.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;We are on the cusp of major, positive change in a lot of fields, just as soon as the ignorant, arrogant, greedy, power tripping, Old Guard gets out of the way and lets the sunlight of new ideas and technologies disinfect the stale, pus encrusted crud of the old, senescent system that is failing on every hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Current Situation in Ecuador&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;After more than a year of intense struggle, the shaman who assaulted me has been  indicted and there will be a trial, beginning in one week.

I may be a sort of  point man, out in front, more visible than others, but there are  assuredly others who have suffered, and are suffering, in silence,  because of fear, ignorance, intimidation, feelings of helplessness,  being overwhelmed by trauma and shock or maybe because they were killed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I  have no illusions about what I am up against.

But the battle is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I could not have come this far without the timely,  crucial support of some of my readers and supporters. And I will not  make it to the end of the process, without the support of still other  readers and supporters. It&#39;s not my battle alone. I may be a sort of  point man, out in front, more visible than others, but there are  assuredly others who have suffered, and are suffering, in silence,  because of fear, ignorance, intimidation, feelings of helplessness,  being overwhelmed by trauma and shock or maybe because they were killed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I  have no illusions about what I am up against.

I retained one of the better known law firms in Quito  and they charge accordingly. They are like attorneys anywhere. They do  not work for a ham sandwich and a glass of lemonade. Especially not in a case like this, out of town, over in the  Amazon, representing a &lt;i&gt;gringo&lt;/i&gt; in a highly unusual case, virtually without precedent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s  what makes it crucial. What happens in the Amazon is vitally important  to what happens on this planet. The shamans of the region theoretically  have an essential role to play in healing the Amazon and showing the way  for humanity -- but not if they themselves are abusive to the very people who come to the region to consult the sacred  power plants in search of hyper-conscious communion with Mother Nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;And  so I need your assistance.

Most people don&#39;t want to be very awake, so they drink alcohol, maybe a lot of alcohol, or take Xanax or Zoloft or Quaalude or Thorazine or heroine or methadone or cocaine&amp;nbsp; or &lt;i&gt;qat / khat&lt;/i&gt; (Google it) or watch hours and hours of television every day or&amp;nbsp; immerse themselves in religious fanaticism,&amp;nbsp; and frequently some combination of two or more of the preceding&amp;nbsp; ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I just described hundreds and hundreds of millions of people, and truth be told, probably billions of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t have to look very far to see why the planet and the human species are in the unfortunate condition they are in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Because my blog reaches many thousands of people all over the world, I know that not all of my readers fall into the demographic above. I also know that due to the kind of subject matter that my blog frequently addresses that a certain percentage of my readers do inquire more deeply into the nature of reality than the majority of people do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For that reason I want to touch briefly in this blog posting on the higher centers of perception in the human organism. Mind you, what I am talking about does not necessarily have anything directly to do with religion or so-called &quot;religious morality,&quot; in that fastidious religiosity may even blind an individual to the higher centers of perception. The higher centers are located in&amp;nbsp; the brain and along the spinal column, notably in the region of the heart and at the center and the very top of the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Awakening them is sometimes a matter of pure, blind luck. You may just stumble unawares into an awakening. More likely is that if you engage in a program of yoga, or meditation, or bio-feedback, or mindful breathing, or deep, contemplative prayer, or fervent chanting of the names of God, or work with shamanic, sacred power plants, or shamanic drumming, or selfless service in love to others -- you just may begin to awaken the higher centers of perception and spiritual awareness in your being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Usually, the awakening process comes about because of concerted, persistent, unrelenting intent to awaken.&amp;nbsp; I have to say at the outset that I am not a self-realized, fully awakened man. My life is a&amp;nbsp; work that is still very much in progress. That said, I do very much see and appreciate the value of awakening the higher centers, especially including the heart center and the third eye center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;In my own way I have time and again partially activated those centers. I have yet to experience a permanent Kundalini awakening of the sort that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6CAU8o4BUM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gopi Krishna&lt;/a&gt; underwent, but I have had repeated, temporary, short-term awakenings of the Kundalini.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the years before I left San Antonio I had a Kundalini experience that differed a little from some of the others. There was the familiar discharge of extremely high-voltage electricity up the spine and out the top of the head, but on that occasion it had a rapid, rhythmic pulsation. The sensation was of being a very powerfully charged, human spark plug. This was about the time that I was making the initial decision to go and conduct a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonviolent, peace protest on a nuclear missile silo at Minot Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, in North Dakota, USSA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;At the same time as the powerful, electrical discharge up the spinal column and out through the top of the head was occurring,&amp;nbsp; I was having a memorable visionary experience in which I was seated in a comfortable chair in a very pleasant, wood paneled room with an expensive wood floor. The ambiance of the room was very commodious. I felt at ease, relaxed and secure. Directly in front of me was a low, expensive coffee table with a glass top. There were a small number of items on the table that attracted my gaze. The ones that most drew my attention were a pair of ancient, translucent turtle shells resting upside down. They were the color of aged, yellowed, writing parchment and were covered all over with inscribed symbols -- runes, magical sigils and alchemical notations. As I was taking all of that in, I raised my eyes to the window that was on the other side of the room, on the other side of the table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Through the window I could see that a massive storm was rapidly approaching. The clouds were dark, low, menacing and moving in very quickly. It was the type of threatening squall line that produces tornadoes, damaging hail, destructive high winds, deadly flash floods, powerful lightning strikes, and the like. As I took it all in, I thought, &quot;Oh, my, that does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; look good.&quot; I consider that as of now, post-Fukushima and on the cusp of major, global financial turmoil and geopolitical upheaval that may possibly involve global warfare (please see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/04/who-ebola-outbreak-among-most-challenging-201448167108213.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;African Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, just to give you one small idea), that we have begun to enter the first fringes of the oncoming storm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It will be a doozy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And I have had other Kundalini experiences over the years. What they tend to have in common is the repeated experience of tremendously powerful electrical surges up the spine and into the head and even out of the top of the head, arcing away into a great, unknowable, inscrutable, indescribable vastness that lies just beyond. There can be visionary and/or auditory experiences of various sorts that accompany the thundering lightning bolt up the spine. There are other senses that open up that are difficult to explain to those who have not had the experience. These would include telepathy, instant knowing, direct intuition, comprehensive unimpeded vision and sensing directly with the heart. The words don&#39;t do the experience justice; they are pale reflections of the richly textured and nuanced reality. The main point is to have no fear. Simply experience it. Flow with the Kundalini.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, I am not the only person to have these sorts of experiences. Many people have had them and will continue to have them as long as there is a human race. I believe that Gopi Krishna is correct that the Kundalini force is a natural evolutionary impulse in the human race, driving us forward to a higher, more advanced state of awareness and being, both as individuals and a species. He died about 30 years ago, but he did leave us a legacy of a number of interviews, some of which are available on Youtube.com, if you care to watch them. He also wrote a number of very inspiring and instructive books that are widely available through major book sellers, in which he describes his singular life experience and the nature of his deep self-realization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For those who are interested in awakening the Kundalini, all I can say is once awakened, even partially,&amp;nbsp; your life will never be the same. Going back to your old life is probably not really possible or advisable. If you are really serious about awakening the Kundalini it is a comprehensive life project that will engage every aspect of your being. If you are not serious about it, don&#39;t start.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s my advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;But if you are serious, you&#39;ll have to eat a healthy diet, lead a simple life, get your rest and keep yourself fit. If you like alcohol or narcotic drugs, you&#39;ll have to leave all that behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I once knew a person who imperiously said to me: &quot;I &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; have alcohol.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;That attitude is not very compatible with higher consciousness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Gopi Krishna&#39;s books are of great value and I recommend them to you.&amp;nbsp; They are available in many bookstores and also online. Just do a key word search on Gopi Krishna and Kundalini. There is also a great deal of worthwhile information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologyofkundalini.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Biology of Kundalini website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For me the most important factor in awakening the Kundalini is clearly strong intent, whether overtly conscious intent, or a strong subconscious inclination in that direction, or both. Where there is a will, there is a way, and those who are strongly interested sooner or later find the way, or make a way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;In my case, I was familiar with the concept of the Kundalini and had heard about yogic lightning bolts up the spine, so when it happened to me I never had any fear. From the first second onward I just inwardly thought, &quot;This must be the Kundalini lightning that I have read about,&quot;&amp;nbsp; and simply let it do what it wanted. I put my conscious mind to the side and just observed what happened without trying to interfere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the advice I would give to anyone. The Kundalini is a cosmically conscious energy that greatly outshines our feeble human intellects. The smart attitude in its presence is one of humility. There is a certain hierarchy in the conscious Universe, and the Kundalini occupies an advanced rank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Those who want to know more about it will make it their business to find out. Those who want to experience the Kundalini will do so. For all I know, there are possibly one or more future Gopi Krishnas reading this blog commentary; individuals who may possibly in the future be self-realized Kundalini yogis of a very advanced degree of consciousness.&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Current Situation in Ecuador&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;After more than a year of intense struggle, the shaman who assaulted me has been  indicted and there will be a trial, beginning in two weeks. I therefore need to pay my attorneys  for assisting me, protecting me, guiding me, advising me and  representing me and my best interests in a prolonged, difficult criminal  proceeding. The process is now halfway complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I  have been pushed to the wall by this ordeal, to my financial limits and  beyond. The case is actually bigger than me, in that there certainly  are other victims of shamanic abuse in the Amazon region. I am not the  only victim. But unlike 99% of the others, I have elected to stand up  and fight back, no matter the odds. And against all expectations, my  assailant has been indicted and is going to trial. But the battle is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I could not have come this far without the timely,  crucial support of some of my readers and supporters. And I will not  make it to the end of the process, without the support of still other  readers and supporters. It&#39;s not my battle alone. I may be a sort of  point man, out in front, more visible than others, but there are  assuredly others who have suffered, and are suffering, in silence,  because of fear, ignorance, intimidation, feelings of helplessness,  being overwhelmed by trauma and shock or maybe because they were killed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I  have no illusions about what I am up against. I was almost killed. I  was hurt very badly. I do not know any other place to begin to right the  wrongs of this world than to engage whatever situation is right in  front of me, the situation that has forced itself to my attention, front  and center. That&#39;s the only way I know to proceed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;To  do that I urgently need your financial assistance to bring the case to a  legal conclusion. I retained one of the better known law firms in Quito  and they charge accordingly. They are like attorneys anywhere. They do  not work for a ham sandwich and a glass of lemonade. And neither would  you! Especially not in a case like this, out of town, over in the  Amazon, representing a &lt;i&gt;gringo&lt;/i&gt; in a highly unusual case, virtually without precedent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s  what makes it crucial. What happens in the Amazon is vitally important  to what happens on this planet. The shamans of the region theoretically  have an essential role to play in healing the Amazon and showing the way  for humanity -- but not if they themselves are criminally corrupt and  abusive to the very people who come to the region to consult the sacred  power plants in search of hyper-conscious communion with Mother Nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;And so I am seriously asking for your aid.

I washed windows in Georgetown and Northwest D.C., Silver Spring, Bethesda, Potomac and across the river in Mt.

I know the place where the cops murdered her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or how about this savage cop beating in Long Beach, California of a prone man who is not physically resisting. &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGjpHIRTx8k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;When the cop hits the man in the legs with his club it cracks like a major league baseball player hitting a fastball out of the ball park&lt;/a&gt;.

The plants are very well aware of the dark plots and conspiracies that are abroad in the world. Certainly, there are those in the USSA government and its allied agencies, and in other agencies who do not want people to know about the hideous, ghastly evil they have planned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Brutalizing people is what they do.

I may be a sort of point man, out in front, more visible than others, but there are assuredly others who have suffered, and are suffering, in silence, because of fear, ignorance, intimidation, feelings of helplessness, being overwhelmed by trauma and shock or maybe because they were killed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;I have no illusions about what I am up against.

That&#39;s the only way I know to proceed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;To do that I urgently need your financial assistance to bring the case to a legal conclusion. I retained one of the better known law firms in Quito and they charge accordingly. They are like attorneys anywhere. They do not work for a ham sandwich and a glass of lemonade. And neither would you! Especially not in a case like this, out of town, over in the Amazon, representing a &lt;i&gt;gringo&lt;/i&gt; in a highly unusual case, virtually without precedent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s what makes it crucial. What happens in the Amazon is vitally important to what happens on this planet. The shamans of the region theoretically have an essential role to play in healing the Amazon and showing the way for humanity -- but not if they themselves are criminally corrupt and abusive to the very people who come to the region to consult the sacred power plants in search of hyper-conscious communion with Mother Nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;And so I am seriously asking for your aid.

There are many miles of trenches and artillery emplacements in the rural district of Varina where I grew up. The Varina Battlefield District is a National Park. In the woods in the neighborhood where I grew up there were old trenches, and massive gun emplacements overlooking the bluffs above the James River on the last approach to Richmond,&amp;nbsp; strategically dug in to resist a long-feared Union assault up the James. The Union forces finally did come, but not quite from that quarter. When I was young there were Civil War-era trenches all around Byrd Field, the main airport in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area, right next door to Seven Pines, where bitter fighting raged, only two or three miles as the crow flies, from my adolescent home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For years, I drove by and roamed those trenches and gun emplacements, again and again. It was as if the war had been but yesterday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Earlier, when I was a small boy, the family lived in the then-rural community of Denbigh, down along the Warwick River, on the grounds of what had formerly been Young&#39;s Plantation. Old man Young, the last of his line, was in his dotage then, feeble and senile. He would sit in a rocking chair on the front porch of the old house, with a musty lap blanket over his knees and rail against the Yankees, how the Yankees were coming and to get ready. He was ancient then, about 100 years old. He was a small boy during the war years and came of age during Reconstruction. The war and its aftermath had left a deep mark on his psyche that persisted right up into the late 1950s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The rotten, crumbing remains of the old slave cabins were still there, out behind the main house, where the gnarled box woods grew. They had been abandoned at war&#39;s end and were in ruins. A short distance away was the stone, spring house, where the spring water still came vigorously bubbling up, clear and pure, from a small opening in the blue-white clay. There were initials carved in the stones by Civil War soldiers who had come there for water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Pickett&#39;s Charge at Gettysburg    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/3po17QbHLRQ&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Later in life, for a variety of reasons, my parents relocated to Adams County, Pennsylvania, the site of the Gettysburg Battlefield National Park. I consequently ended up crossing that battlefield more times than I can remember, walking the streets of Gettysburg, and going for long walks in the Adams County countryside, through endless miles of neatly kept orchards that carpet the region&#39;s rolling hills -- mostly apple, but also a good deal of peach, and some cherry and pear -- two miles, three, four, five miles, walking along lost in thought, reflecting on everything, including the Civil War.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;When the 150 Confederate artillery pieces opened up before Pickett&#39;s  charge at Gettysburg, the thunderous roar was heard 140 miles away in Pittsburgh. Eleven thousand men  advanced across one mile of open ground into a withering hail of musket  and rifle fire, cannon balls and grape shot. By the time it was over the  field was carpeted with thousands of dead and dying men.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Richard Dolan, the publisher of my last book on &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;underground and underwater bases&lt;/a&gt;, shot this March 2010 video of me right there in Adams County and we ended up standing on the Gettysburg Battlefield to talk about the White Rose movement, starting at the 32 minute mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/wpWA1FrTOoE&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The following month, I traveled to North Dakota, USA and  on 15 April 2010 went over the security fence onto a U.S. Air Force  Minuteman-III nuclear missile silo, near Parshall, North Dakota. I  conducted a nonviolent, peace demonstration on the missile silo. I left  large sea shells on the missile launch lid, pure quartz crystals, a gold  and silver coin, a copy of the United States Constitution and other documents. &lt;a href=&quot;http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=149495;article=130068;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There was a massive response by the U.S. military, and civilian police agencies, who came with great force to the silo to arrest me&lt;/a&gt;.  They blocked off the road, at the intersection of 33rd Street and 76th  Avenue, and brought in a tactical response team by helicopter to arrest  me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I had gone over the security fence, barbed wire and all, with my crystal necklaces and crystal-feather headdress. I left the bouquet of white roses on the outside of the fence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I was jailed for 100 days. Jail is always unpleasant, what more can I say? And yet I have repeatedly risked the discomfort and danger of jail and prison, in an effort to awaken any and all individuals who may be susceptible to awakening. I&#39;ve been incarcerated in a dozen different jails and prisons in Arkansas, Georgia, Texas. Missouri and North Dakota, for visiting other nuclear missile silos and military facilities where nuclear weapons are deployed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I issued my &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Minot Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;   to the press on 15 April 2010, the same day I went over the fence onto the missile silo. It explains my distinctive dress and my   reasons for nonviolent civil disobedience. It is one of the most   important documents I have ever written, and yet it is among the least   read of my writings. Most people prefer the easy, the sensational, the   superficial, the quick, the shallow. They prefer not to read things that require them to think very deeply, or to maybe take courageous action themselves. And that&#39;s the reason we have so   many problems as a species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lfq2g2iGvYA/UzDy0duyXXI/AAAAAAAAAHw/ku6XNdj8f0o/s1600/Richard%27s+White+Rose+photo.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lfq2g2iGvYA/UzDy0duyXXI/AAAAAAAAAHw/ku6XNdj8f0o/s1600/Richard&#39;s+White+Rose+photo.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;While in jail, I also issued to the press  another statement, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/serious-message-from-heart-of-america.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Serious Message From The Heart Of America&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, I was preoccupied then with the question of war, and I still am. Humanity has been beset by the plague of warfare for unknown thousands of years. The threat of nuclear war in our day is real enough and could literally happen at any instant. It would be hellish beyond belief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I have said it before and probably will again: I don&#39;t know why everyone isn&#39;t out on the nuclear missile silos protesting, or at the nuclear power plants demonstrating. It&#39;s as if the terrestrial human species has no skin in the Great Game going down on its home planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t get it. I really don&#39;t. The nuclear issue is huge. And not just the nuclear weapons, though they are plenty dangerous enough. The ongoing crisis at the exploded and melted down nuclear reactors at Fukushima, Japan is apparently not susceptible of resolution with the present level of&amp;nbsp; industrial technological expertise. Humanity has created a pitiless, radioactive monster that it cannot tame or bring to heel. The Pacific Ocean is being outright killed right now, as a direct consequence. In recent weeks there has also been a catastrophic failure of the so-called WIPP nuclear waste storage facility in southern New Mexico, USA, that has released dangerous amounts of plutonium and americeum to the outside environment. You can follow both of these urgent stories&amp;nbsp; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enenews.com/&quot;&gt;www.enenews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nuclear False Flag Alert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I have previously warned of the real risk of nuclear false flag attacks on American cities as a means of creating a war panic, and justification for a general, nuclear war. The shamanic plants in the Upper Amazon brought this to my attention about a year and a half ago. Several cities were pointed out to me as possible candidate sites for such attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The plants mentioned a shadowy, well-organized, extremely nefarious international group that has plans to do this. If the attacks happen, they will not be as they are made to seem. The hand that lights the nuclear fuse will be well-concealed and absolutely will strive to deflect public attention from its evil deeds by falsely blaming other parties. While this faction was given no specific name by the plants, my personal assessment is that the usual suspects would be involved:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the Israeli Mossad, British MI-6, the American CIA and NSA, the French Piscine, the German BND, etc. In today&#39;s world, the impetus to global war is coming largely from the USSA, NATO and the Israelis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;There is an old African saying that: &quot;The guilty will speak.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And wouldn&#39;t you know that just today, Barack Obama mentioned at the Nuclear Security Summit in the Hague, Netherlands that he is concerned about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-im-concerned-about-loose-nuke-being-detonated-manhattan_786009.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a nuclear weapon being detonated in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I repeat to you that that possible scenario is straight out of the Amazonian &quot;shamanic&quot;&amp;nbsp; briefing that I was given a year and a half ago. It&#39;s a page from that very play book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And then Barack Obama sat down to play a nuclear crisis game with other national leaders that revolved around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10721186/Merkel-miffed-at-Barack-Obama-and-David-Cameron-nuclear-war-game.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatened detonation of a dirty atomic bomb in an unspecified western city&lt;/a&gt;: New York, London, Milan, etc. This again is an uncanny echo of what the shamanic plants warned me about: a plot to detonate nuclear devices in several different cities, to cause a war panic, and create a &lt;i&gt;casus belli&lt;/i&gt; for &quot;totalitarian nuclear warfare.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Oh, it is a dark and wicked plan. I hasten to add, though, that it does not have to happen, the future is not set in stone, and is always amenable to change; however, the daily headlines do seem to be trending in that unfortunate direction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ZJv86RpLsVQ&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; it starts, it will be like diabolical,  nuclear popcorn popping. And then it will get hellish beyond belief.  Something like this scene from &lt;i&gt;The Last of the Mohicans&lt;/i&gt;, only  unimaginably worse, more deadly, more confusing, more world-changing,  more hellish. Trust me on this: you don&#39;t ever in your life want to see  anything like that. Whatever romantic fantasy some of you might have  running in your heads about surviving nuclear war, or an apocalyptic,  dystopian &quot;survivor&quot; world, forget about it. It will be ghastly beyond  all telling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Just one of the many problems that would occur is that, as the systemic confusion and collapse spreads, and it would be a very rapid and very confused collapse, some or maybe many or almost all of the 400+ nuclear reactors in the northern hemisphere will also explode and/or melt down, as has already happened at Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan. Think about it. When the engineers and operators don&#39;t come to work anymore, because they are dead, or the roads are impassable, or they have to stay home to try to defend their families against rogue bands of violent marauders, or government and the banks have failed and they are not being paid anything at all -- well, the plants will fail. The reactors will melt down or explode. And there will not be anyone to fix them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Not ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Then&amp;nbsp; you will see Fukushima in New York City or Los Angeles or Chicago or Philadelphia or Miami or Phoenix or Dallas or Paris or Bordeaux or Lyons or London or Madrid or Zurich or Rome or Karachi or Bombay or pretty well all of Japan or a great deal of India or coastal China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And very likely most or all of that and more will happen, essentially simultaneously. That is why even a so-called &quot;limited&quot; nuclear war would/will bring a cataclysm, an apocalypse, a nuclear hell on Earth that could decimate humanity by the hundreds of millions and billions. The panic, chaos, death, destruction and horror would be completely off the charts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;That is why I have been out on the nuclear missile silos again and again, over a thirty year period, even at the cost of jail and prison, possible death, financial impoverishment, public ridicule, a lengthy arrest record, abusive and intrusive government surveillance and violations of my civil rights, and more. That is what we are facing. This is no science fiction fantasy. This is the real world we are living in. It is all rigged to &lt;b&gt;KILL YOU&lt;/b&gt; and the entire planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Do you get it? &lt;b&gt;Do you ??&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Do you really ??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Look at all the nuclear power plants in the USSA. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuclearinfo.net/twiki/pub/Nuclearpower/CurrentReactors/world_map.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click this link&lt;/a&gt;. Look at all those red dots in the USSA, in Europe and European Russia and Japan. That&#39;s where the nuclear power plants are. A good 90% of my readers live in precisely those areas of the world where the nuclear reactors are concentrated. When the system fails, what do you think is going to happen to all of those hundreds of nuclear reactors? If the electricity goes down? If the cooling pumps fail? If the computers fail? If the operators, technicians and engineers do not come to work anymore, for any one one of a dozen different reasons? The nuclear power plants will fail, by the scores and hundreds and humanity and this whole planet&amp;nbsp; will have literal &lt;u&gt;Hell&lt;/u&gt; to pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;So this is not an idle question. When every snow storm, every thundershower, every windy spring day brings a sleet of invisible plutonium and cesium and strontium and uranium and americium to wherever you are, what will you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Is your Glock or your 12-gauge Remington or your AK-47 or your AR-15 going to protect your from that? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why I Advertise Gold and Silver On My Blog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;First of all, I do it because the ownership of &lt;a href=&quot;http://libertygoldandsilver.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liberty Gold and Silver&lt;/a&gt; contacted me to ask if I was willing to put up some simple ads for gold and silver on my website. It wasn&#39;t something that I solicited, indeed, I had not previously had any contact with them. However, when they asked I immediately consented to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The fact is that we stand poised at a great crossroads on this planet. We have to start doing an awful lot of things differently, and not in the far distant future. We have to start immediately, or else we may not have a future on this planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It is possible that terrestrial humanity is about to go extinct. At a minimum, we have to completely do away with all nuclear technology &lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt; -- all nuclear power plants, all nuclear weapons, all nuclear waste dumps, all uranium mines and uranium mills have to go. Permanently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;We have to have a massive, global, reforestation project. We have to make tree planting and reforestation a sort of religion, to resuscitate and revitalize the Earth. I am talking about the planting of literally billions of trees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And we need to clean the seas, lakes, swamps, marshes and rivers of trash and toxic contaminants. We have to purify and cleanse the planet&#39;s hydrosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;We &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; do these things. These are absolutely not optional action items. The current political and business leadership on this planet are not doing these things, so they have to go. They have to leave the stage, because they are a clear danger and present threat to all humanity and the entire planet. They are not worthy of the sacred charge of national and international leadership with which they have been entrusted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;One of the things that is going to happen as we move further into the weeks, months and few years that lie just ahead, is that there will be a great crisis involving the fiat currencies such as the American dollar,&amp;nbsp; the Euro, the British pound, etc. There are tremendous systemic weaknesses in the fiat currencies and the major markets that use them to transact global commerce, in the City of London, Lower Manhattan, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;When this system fails, perhaps suddenly and catastrophically, fiat paper currency will suddenly be seen to have the full value it has had all along -- that of a little scrap of paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Those who have some gold and silver will at least have something tangible in their hands. For thousands of years, across cultures, historical periods and continents, gold and silver have been perceived as having intrinsic value and inherent monetary worth. That is still true today. That is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2014-02-10/china-gold-buying-surges-41-1176-tonnes-2013&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;China bought 1176 tonnes of gold last year&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The Chinese know what is coming. They hold a lot of almost worthless American debt, so they are using their time wisely to transition to a massive store of tangible wealth: &lt;u&gt;gold&lt;/u&gt;. Therefore, when the American house of paper wealth collapses, the Chinese will be left with thousands of tons of gold, while the Americans will have plenty of time to sift through and count&amp;nbsp; their thousands of tons of paper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;So if you are able, and can feasibly do it without jeopardizing your present well-being, now would be a prudent time to acquire &lt;a href=&quot;http://libertygoldandsilver.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some gold or silver of your own&lt;/a&gt; and use it in the best way(s) you know to help transition through the time of great change that is hard upon us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Anyone who pays conscious attention to global events can see that huge change lies ahead. It is inevitable. In fact, the changes have already begun. We have entered a very rough patch in the road as a species and as a planet. That is the plain, bare truth. Fukushima alone is a global game changer. Those who survive in some degree of comfort, or even flourish, will be those who are prepared. Countless millions of individuals who are not paying attention will not fare well at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ayahuasca Visions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; that I have written about before, aspects of which &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; has revealed to me again and again, plays into this whole scenario. We are facing an implacable foe, a pitiless adversary, that has insinuated itself into every minute aspect of our world and being, It is everywhere, in our psychology, in our minds, in our cultures and societies, in our political, economic, business, military, industrial and religious institutions and organizations. In our warring, in our whoring, in our war whoring, in our planetary rape, pillage and plunder, in our rampant criminality, in our runaway environmental destruction and contamination, in the demoniac genetic tampering and engineering of Frankenstein, transgenic organisms that are even now wreaking ecological havoc, in the monstrous nuclear technology that has escaped to the wild and is now devastating the world, in the rampant digital, electronic espionage of the American NSA, in nano-technology -- in all of this and much more,&lt;i&gt; The Machine&lt;/i&gt; is intimately involved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It means to take this planet down. It means to enslave, subjugate. And maybe annihilate humanity. The hard truth is that its plans are well advanced, and it has literal legions of (in)human accomplices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Who are they? Well, all of those millions of people who are uranium miners, or nuclear missile manufacturers, or nuclear power plant operators, or chemical pesticide salesman, or genetic engineers, or weapons manufacturers, or Wall Street brokers, or fiat currency bankers, or machine politicians, or crime cartel members, or .... the list can be extended on and on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;But you see the point. You add up all of the people involved in systematically harming this planet and getting paid to do it, and their numbers run into the many millions. A significant fraction of humanity is tied up in killing the planet and attacking humanity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Why do they do it? For some, a brass name plate on their office door is all the motivation they need. Others may need a lot of money, or drugs, or power, human sacrifice (as in physical killing of people), or a security clearance, or a big house, or an expensive automobile, or Armani suits and Gucci shoes, whatever. And for those things, they are prepared to kill, torture, steal and destroy the Earth. They are willing to take down the whole planet, and they &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; taking down the whole planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It is a firm guarantee that a certain number of these strange creatures, these foul demons in human form, are reading this blog of mine. I can say that because of all the many thousands of people who read my writings, all over the world, including in places like the City of London and other similar precincts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I want to put up a video of Paulina Rubio&#39;s song, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;El Último Adiós. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/YRLRDvChClM&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Quite a lot could be said about the song and the video, too, as far as that goes. Just to mention one minor point, what can the little dog on the bed possibly be thinking about Paulina Rubio, what she&#39;s doing, the people on the set shooting the video, and all of the activity that&#39;s going on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;One other minor point I want to make, that&#39;s actually probably not so minor, is the grinning, white face that appears at about the&amp;nbsp; 3:07 and 3:08 minute mark in the video. This type of face is very reminiscent of the sort of spirit that you can sometimes see in &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; visions. They are imps, or devils or demons. And they are real. They cause mischief, harm, spirit possession and worse. The understanding of traditional &lt;i&gt;ayahuasqueros&lt;/i&gt; is that these beings are real, they actually exist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I am in full agreement. They are all around us, even now, and sometimes you actually see their images, or the imps themselves, inhabiting the personalities of ostensible humans, who appear outwardly in popular culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Other people have seen this &lt;i&gt;Machine &lt;/i&gt;in various ways. I have heard from a number of them, including a friend who asked me to mentally put her in contact with the perception of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Machine&lt;/i&gt;. I did this, without telling her exactly when and how I would do it. Here is her response:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today I woke in the small hours and realized that you had made the experience   available to me.&amp;nbsp; I understood something that my inexperience with power plants  and the word  &quot;visions&quot; had previously kept from me: that what occurs in visions is a direct, real  encounter with the thing itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And you have done this many times. Your courage is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The construct was covered with a translucent white membrane, which I realized  was my  protections. They are automatic but can be repealed. I lifted up the membrane and directly  observed the construct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was frankly demonic. It calls to human beings to give in to the worst of their motives; the  ultimate result is not satiation but destruction.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;….. Believe me, this is a very different morning from any other that I have experienced. The  hard demonic quality underlies the bright morning like the taste of brass. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Final Word On Bitcoin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I am still working with Bitcoin, and intend to continue doing so. As the fiat currencies fall by the wayside, it seems to me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://libertygoldandsilver.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gold and silver, and the other precious metals like platinum, palladium and rhodium&lt;/a&gt; will have much greater currency, because they are physically tangible measures of value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I also continue to see a future for the so-called crypto-currencies or alt-coins, of which Bitcoin is the first and still best-known exemplar. They are decentralized, global and not under the control of the central banks. As of now, they have value; value as mediums of exchange, and also value as investments, for those who understand the crypto-currency markets and are savvy operators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;As it happens, it is possible to acquire Bitcoin for free, and also some of the other crypto-currencies or alt-coins. There are a great variety of websites that have sprung up that offer small, fractional amounts of Bitcoin and other alt-coins for free. All you have to do is sign up and regularly go to the websites, or, in some cases, just sign up, and the operators give you a small daily increment of Bitcoin and other alt-coins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The best, new, free program out there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://qoinpro.com/846e1a68399bd5865660b55dd0856ee4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qoin Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It is absolutely free to join. It pays a  percentage 4 levels deep, to potentially be extended to 7 levels, on all of your  referrals, up to 40% on your first level, if you get a lot of referrals. &lt;a href=&quot;http://qoinpro.com/846e1a68399bd5865660b55dd0856ee4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qoin Pro&lt;/a&gt; pays &lt;u&gt;every&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;day&lt;/u&gt;.  You sign up for free, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://qoinpro.com/846e1a68399bd5865660b55dd0856ee4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qoin Pro&lt;/a&gt; pays daily to Bitcoin, Litecoin,  FeatherCoin, FedoraCoin and InfiniteCoin addresses. They pay like  clockwork. All you have to do is sign up. What&#39;s not to like? The amounts they pay are very small, so the key to success with this  program is obviously to sign up other people. If you can sign up a lot of people, over time, you can do extremely well with this program, keeping in mind that it is free to join.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The operators of Qoin Pro are young Dutch IT professionals, and reading their FAQ, it looks to me like they are establishing a membership base from which to launch a larger Bitcoin and alt-coin business venture, in the coming months and years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I have seen the same thing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18U9wEMVGCZf8eXDJWxYaK1ykXe8RF1HcK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Billions&lt;/a&gt;. The operators are clearly planning to greatly expand their program in the coming months and years. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18U9wEMVGCZf8eXDJWxYaK1ykXe8RF1HcK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Billions&lt;/a&gt; is also free to join, though only active members will make any money, and those who upgrade will make the most. Still, it is free to join and you can make money as a free member. But you do have to actively work the program and carry out the simple tasks it requires. I have noticed&amp;nbsp; time and time again that there are people who sign up for programs under me and then do nothing at all. As a result they gain nothing at all. They do nothing, and they get nothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t understand it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The following free programs continue to regularly pay me. How do they do it? Why do they do it? I don&#39;t know! They are all free to join. So why not sign up and get some free Bitcoin. Just follow the simple instructions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6fa8dc;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6fa8dc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinad.com/?r=N73IPLX3HIEU3OI&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coin Ad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6fa8dc;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoiner.net/&quot;

The negative consequences of a NATO/ USSA military clash with Russia include the very real threat of a nuclear conflict, since both sides are very heavily armed with a full array of nuclear ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, torpedoes and bombs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;China has viewed the rapidly developing crisis with a thoroughly jaundiced eye and has warned against sanctions by the USSA against Russia due to the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-tiger-awakens-china-warns-of-retaliatory-action-and-unforeseeable-consequences-over-u-s-monday-deadline_03142014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unforeseeable consequences&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-tiger-awakens-china-warns-of-retaliatory-action-and-unforeseeable-consequences-over-u-s-monday-deadline_03142014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retaliatory action&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&amp;nbsp; that such sanctions might engender.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Given that China holds $1.3 trillion of the USSA&#39;s government debt, which it could willy-nilly dump, with disastrous effects on the American economy, and also has a full brace of nuclear missiles that can reach the USSA mainland and its numerous military bases in the Pacific region, the warning is not an empty threat.

This is also near Israel, off the coast of Syria. The message could not be clearer that Russia intends to stand by its long-time ally Syria, at the same time that it sends a cautionary message to Israel. It is fair to assume that the Kuznetsov battle group is carrying nuclear weapons, as do USSA aircraft carrier battle groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Speaking of which, the Pentagon has announced that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-ukraine-crisis-pentagon-idUSBREA2D1D820140314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush will be remaining in the Mediterranean a few more days&lt;/a&gt; due to the crisis in Ukraine.

If they do, the following day the USSA government will announce punitive measures against Russia. After that, the Russians and Chinese will take whatever steps they feel are appropriate, and then the USSA government and its allies will take further steps in response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;This entire scenario is fraught with profound peril for the whole world. I don&#39;t know what is going to happen, but a hard shock to the global financial system, in the coming days and weeks, appears highly possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The more so as financial astrologers are unanimously pointing to April 2014 (next month) as being a period of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zentrader.ca/blog/?p=22150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;financial crisis for the USSA economy and its so-called &quot;Federal Reserve Bank.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; I am not a financial astrologer, but I have to say that their prognostications are right on the money. April is shaping up to be a period of intense crisis for the USSA and its financial system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I do not presume that in a war with Russia and China, be it a nuclear exchange or a financial showdown, that the USSA and its European allies will necessarily prevail. J.P. Morgan, the early-20th century Robber Baron, famously said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/02/20/can-planets-affect-your-portfolio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;millionaires do not have astrologers, but billionaires do&lt;/a&gt;. For millennia, kings, queens, emperors, and now presidents, premiers and prime ministers, have been consulting astrologers. I would be very surprised if the Chinese and Russians do not take full advantage of the propitious astrology of April 2014 to take the USSA government and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank down a peg.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Though I am not a financial adviser, it does seem prudent to me for people who are aware of the confusion that is coming to use the period of time right now to prepare for future contingencies that may arrive within mere weeks. If the USSA financial system crashes hard, and that possibility realistically exists, then the American dollar is going to lose value, perhaps a great deal of value, and most of the world will feel the effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Paper currency, any paper currency, becomes just paper when enough people lose confidence in its value. Historically, silver and gold have held their value across thousands of years. I do not have any gold and silver, or platinum, palladium or rhodium, either. &lt;a href=&quot;http://libertygoldandsilver.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;But if I were financially able I would certainly obtain some and take physical possession of it&lt;/a&gt;. I would do it this very day. We are entering a period of high uncertainty right now and no one knows how long it will last, or how severe the crisis may become. One thing is certain: those who are least prepared, physically, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, financially, socially, etc. will fare the worst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;So get ready. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donations and Tips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the writing, ideas, thoughts and information in my blog, I do accept donations and tips.

I do not know everything that is down there. I am not an insider, so I am not privy to that information. But my research and conversations strongly point to clandestine nuclear missiles that are deployed deep underground, in great secrecy. A lot of people think that if there were a shooting nuclear war, that the conflict would be over in a matter of days, maybe even a few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;This is not necessarily the case. My research revealed plans to put missiles and crews deep underground, in secret installations. They would have the capability to burrow out from underground at unpredictable intervals -- 3 weeks? 6 months? a year? -- and fire off the missiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;So you see how chaotic a nuclear war could be. What happens when or if the USSA, the Chinese, the Russians, the Israelis, Pakistanis, Indians,&amp;nbsp; etc. have a shooting nuclear war and the general confusion leads to isolated pockets of nuclear missileers and their missiles, whether in deep running submarines or in deeply buried tunnel systems, being out of communication with their headquarters? What happens when they know there has been a nuclear strike on their home country, but receive no further communication? What do they do then? Do they go rogue? Do they launch their missiles ? How many? When?

And rest assured, the Russians and Chinese have their respective underground and underwater facilities and nuclear missiles and powerful submarines with missiles that can reach the mainland USSA within 25 minutes or less. If their submarines are quietly lurking offshore then the mainland USSA targets would be in play within 5 minutes or less. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;What happens then?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;This is not an idle question on my part, because the world situation is dangerously volatile right now. There is an enormously serious military confrontation brewing right now between Russia (probably allied with China and Iran) and the axis of the USSA, NATO, Israel, Australia, South Korea and Japan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ukraine is one flash point. The Middle East is another flash point. The Korean peninsula is yet another. And small, disputed, rocky islands in the South China Sea are still one more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;We are close to a major war right now. There is no question that the USSA is on a trajectory of war with Russia. The Pentagon is making plans for it. Those with delusions of global domination on Wall Street, in the City of London, in the Pentagon and Herzliyah are mad men. Psychotically unbalanced. Pathocrats.

That is what I was shown, according to the timeline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Is Nothing New&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Anyone who has read the ancient Indian &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vedas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; realizes that in remote antiquity it was well known that there are numerous inhabited planets in the Universe, and a great variety of other intelligent beings and civilizations in the galaxy, including a great many who are actually human or human-like. That&#39;s what the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vedas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; explicitly say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;However, for the last few thousand years, this information has been vigorously suppressed by the various ruling factions who have held the Earth in thrall. Whatever their motivation may be, they have wanted the human population on Earth to believe that we are all alone in the Universe, that there is no life on other planets, and certainly no intelligent life on other planets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;That has never been the case, and after thousands of years, the policy is beginning to change.

Four of the planets are considered to be within their parent star&#39;s &quot;habitable zone,&quot; i.e., they are in the region where liquid water should exist. Which is to say, the planets are presumed to be Earth-like, and potentially habitable by biological life forms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Given the decades-long, covert E.T. and UFO investigations of the USSA alphabet soup, military and espionage agencies, they have certainly known for a long time that there are myriad other inhabited planets throughout the Universe. But what makes this announcement interesting is the public, almost off-handed admission that, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Oh, yeah, some of the planets that we have found are in the sweet spot, in the zone that is potentially habitable by biological life.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In recent years there has also been a spate of news articles and scientific articles about the discovery of traces of biological life in meteorites that have been scientifically examined. One meteorite is said to contain traces of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sci-news.com/space/article00933.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ancient, alien algae&lt;/a&gt;. Another meteorite thought to be of ancient Martian provenance shows traces of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/nasa1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;primitive, bacteria-like organisms.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Here are some&lt;a href=&quot;http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/marslife/photos.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; photos of the evidence&lt;/a&gt; from an official NASA website. And there are others, but these few examples suffice to demonstrate the point. NASA and the scientific community have already admitted not just the possibility, but the existence of life on other planets, based on the evidence they have found in the meteorites they have examined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the realm of popular culture, for more than a century there has been a gradual, concerted program of mass preparation of the terrestrial population for the reality of intelligent life on other planets. This began in 1897, with H.G. Wells&#39; &lt;i&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/i&gt; science fiction novel, dealing with a Martian military invasion and occupation of Earth, and continued with the famous radio adaptation of the novel by Orson Welles in 1938, which caused a temporary, mass panic on the part of listeners who were convinced by the broadcast that a Martian invasion of Earth was actually underway. In subsequent decades there has been a parade of television shows and feature films that treat of the theme of UFOs and E.T.s. Among others could be mentioned the 1950s classic movie, &lt;i&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp; the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie and merchandise franchise, the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;multiple &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; television series and movies,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/i&gt;, E.T.&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Independence Day&lt;/i&gt;, the&lt;i&gt; Men in Black&lt;/i&gt; franchise, the independent movie,&lt;i&gt; District 9&lt;/i&gt;, the television miniseries, &lt;i&gt;&quot;V,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Disney&#39;s more recent, &lt;i&gt;John Carter&lt;/i&gt;, and many more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The net effect has been to leaven the mass consciousness with the idea of extra-terrestrial life, some of it human, some of it human-like, and some of it bizarrely alien. Truth be told, this probably reflects the reality of the galaxy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stand By For &quot;&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Announcement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Very much in line with my timeline vision, the self-appointed, planetary poobahs are expecting the discovery of intelligent, extra-terrestrial life &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/33361-alien-life-extraterrestrials-20-years-astronomers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;within the next twenty years&lt;/a&gt;, according to the director of the Russian Academy of Sciences&#39; Applied Astronomy Institute, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/01/alien-life-discovery-implications_n_2568280.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even within ten years&lt;/a&gt;, according to the World Economic Forum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Translation: it&#39;s already a done deal.

But later in this century, likely sometime during the 2020s, there will be a sort of initial, public unveiling of extra-terrestrial life to the great masses of global humanity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;All of the events and happenings I mention above are but prelude to that planned, staged opening to extra-terrestrial realities. It is all heavily scripted and controlled. For the life of me I do not know why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The other planets are already there and have been for aeons.

I still don&#39;t!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I say that because drinking &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt; has changed me and my perceptions a lot. I can&#39;t say that the shamanic path is for everyone. The plants themselves are not always easy. You could start with the taste of &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca,&lt;/i&gt; which is positively dreadful. I have to brace myself every time I drink it. I can&#39;t stand it. Beyond the unpleasant taste it frequently can have a purgative effect, i.e., it may induce projectile vomiting and/or diarrhea. In my view, ignorant people who speak of addiction to &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; simply do not know what they are talking about. I cannot imagine being addicted to it. It&#39;s not the kind of thing you do for a recreational high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Beyond that, the visions and telepathic information that it can convey may at times be very unsettling. It has been said that &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#39;t necessarily give you what you want, but what you need. Or, I would add, maybe what &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I bring that up because &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; has repeatedly shown me the same vision, or thematically similar visions, over a period of more than three years. It is a hard vision of reality to accept. And yet it has shown it to me again and again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;At the outset, before first drinking &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt;, I had keenly anticipated having blissful visions of communion with Nature, of ancient Atlantis, visions of civilizations on other planets, the Egyptian pyramids, divine rapture, psychologically and emotionally integrative experiences, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;However, virtually none of that has been given to me. What I have seen, instead,&amp;nbsp; is far harder, harsh and alarming. In a word, we, humanity, and the Earth itself, are under a pitiless assault by an unrelenting, merciless, sort of predatory intelligence or vampiric &lt;i&gt;Machine&lt;/i&gt;; in that it seems artificial and without a soul. It is vastly superficial and heartless, but endlessly devious, cunning and calculating and quite formidable. I do not know where it came from, or where or how it originated, but it is here. It has seamlessly intertwined and integrated itself into every aspect of our world and reality. It operates in the physical, 3-D world of our everyday life, and also on the astral level of what might be called the spirit world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This &lt;i&gt;Machine&lt;/i&gt; does not mean well. It has studied humanity and this world in detail, inside and out, and is systematically taking us down. I was shown that it actually preys on the subtle, vital, life juice of humans, so to speak. At an astral level, it siphons off people&#39;s life energy. I was shown this happening. I saw people&#39;s vital charge being sucked away, like cows being milked on a dairy farm. And I have seen the deadly, superficial system that this Machine has overlaid on this world and on humanity. I am no less susceptible to it than&amp;nbsp; you or anyone else. You see it everywhere. You might even liken &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt; to a deviously enticing but nevertheless fake reality template, that is fiendishly overlaid on &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;real reality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, so to speak, to lead humanity astray.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Hollywood.

If things continue as they are for much longer, it will prevail and humanity and the Earth will have been decimated. Match point to &lt;i&gt;The Machine&lt;/i&gt;, Wherever it comes from, and whoever or whatever created it and unleashed it on this solar system, it is a weapon &lt;i&gt;par excellence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lorde Have Mercy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I have poked fun at a number of so-called &quot;pop&quot; stars recently, including:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com.ec/imgres?sa=X&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=624&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbnid=IWrp69_SxQHTUM%3A&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.santabanta.com%2Fphotos%2Fjustin-bieber%2F7046005.htm&amp;amp;docid=pmgq0_0_ygS6gM&amp;amp;imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.santabanta.com%2Ffull1%2FGlobal%252520Celebrities%28M%29%2FJustin%252520Bieber%2Fjustin-bieber-5a.jpg&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=768&amp;amp;ei=FaMGU8OUK4zAkQfZhoHwCw&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;ved=0CGYQhBwwAA&amp;amp;iact=rc&amp;amp;dur=1415&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;ndsp=14&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Won&#39;t Someone Please &quot;Just Burp Me Boy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; the ever distasteful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com.ec/imgres?biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=624&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbnid=0pEzmHXkoLA1XM%3A&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.radio.com%2F2013%2F11%2F12%2Flady-gaga-says-malala-yousafzai-really-deserves-glamours-women-of-the-year-cover%2F&amp;amp;docid=vzojREbCl-9MUM&amp;amp;imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcbsradionews.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F11%2Flady-gaga1.jpg&amp;amp;w=770&amp;amp;h=433&amp;amp;ei=76MGU6HJMoTRkQfCoIHwDA&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;ved=0CIUBEIQcMA4&amp;amp;iact=rc&amp;amp;dur=755&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;start=13&amp;amp;ndsp=25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Gag Me Girl&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, the vapid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com.ec/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;docid=yKkkh0-L-ZJbNM&amp;amp;tbnid=nap_SiQGeeu-DM:&amp;amp;ved=0CAUQjRw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bleedingcool.com%2F2014%2F01%2F24%2Fcomixology-all-over-the-world-the-walking-dead-is-beyonce-and-hawkeye-is-not%2Fbeyonce-4%2F&amp;amp;ei=eaUGU7boDs_LkQfRiIGYBA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.61725948,d.eW0&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNE9Q8eBYhhARXXLmVSH0vdtBNfZdQ&amp;amp;ust=1393030688728435&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Bouncy Girl&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and why not add the &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/01/article-0-1B8DBEC7000005DC-188_634x906.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Smiley Virus&quot;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;They are certainly all way out of the league of the young singer Lorde, who does have musical talent and won a Grammy award recently, occasioning an acceptance speech that was immediately censored by USSA network TV.

Is this connected to FBI documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act that revealed &lt;a href=&quot;http://whowhatwhy.com/2013/06/27/fbi-document-deleted-plots-to-kill-occupy-leaders-if-deemed-necessary/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plans to kill Occupy Movement leaders by targeted sniper fire?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Is the USSA government preparing to blow away a lot of people with &quot;targeted sniper fire&quot;?

It&#39;s transparently obvious to me. The totalitarian dictatorship that &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; showed to me two years ago is being methodically set in place. It was a clear vision, like looking at a computer monitor. Current events are resembling more and more closely what I was shown. The USSA government is irretrievably wicked. Its agents will kill people. That&#39;s what the NDAA is all about. There won&#39;t be a trail of evidence or a trial. They&#39;ll just eliminate people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If you need an image to bring it into focus, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/spsoaunion/10138602914/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo of DHS ICE special agents training for a national security &quot;emergency.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Does that not look ominous? Note that the American flag is conspicuously reversed. Get it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As for the threat of a major, international war, it is real, and growing by the day. The USSA at present is clearly on a trajectory to a military confrontation with Russia, China, Syria and Iran and maybe more. The conflict may well go nuclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The threat of one or more &lt;u&gt;spectacular&lt;/u&gt;, notorious &quot;false flag&quot; attacks to create a war panic is also very real. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;My advice to anyone who is inclined to leave the USSA is to leave just as soon as you can feasibly manage it. Better to be a little bit early than a little bit too late. When the doors are slammed shut and the Feds are rounding people up, or using those 141,000 rounds of sniper ammo to liquidate people on their &quot;watch lists&quot;, it will be too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Sometimes God helps those who help themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donations and Tips &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If you like the writing, ideas, thoughts and information in my blog, I do accept donations and tips.

But everywhere you look there is deceit, cover-up, deception, layers of spying and compartmentalized espionage, mind control, lying, plots and schemes and scams and conspiracies, war and plans for war, ever shifting alliances for and against, false history, fake science, corrupt politics, criminal economics, genocidal religion, flimflam gurus and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s extremely difficult, bordering on almost impossible, to know with precision, exactly what is happening on this one small planet right now -- let alone what has happened here in the historical past, say within the most recent few thousands of years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And beyond that, no one that I know can say &lt;u&gt;exactly&lt;/u&gt;, with authority, what happened on Earth ten or twenty or thirty or forty or fifty thousand years ago.

Parks himself says that he received the information in his books via an extraordinary, mind-blowing information download directly to his waking consciousness of a vast, galactic history, spanning unimaginable stretches of time and space, and involving a host of factions, races, civilizations, and star systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ura&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;š&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; is the Earth.

Some of the beings from elsewhere are human or human-like, some are cyborgs or clone drones, some are reptilian or insectoid -- and some are too bizarre to be easily classified or understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Another of the main messages of the UFO literature is that there is an enormous cover-up related to UFOs, interplanetary realities and life forms from elsewhere. This cover-up is especially intense on the part of the alphabet soup agencies of the USSA government. You can positively smell the fear of the control freaks at the NSA, NRO, CIA and the Pentagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Having said that, the stealthy furtiveness of the hermetically compartmentalized, official cover-up is also aided and abetted by the beings from elsewhere, who themselves go skulking about, surreptitiously flitting hither and thither, appearing and disappearing, behaving cryptically, and speaking in riddles-- when they deign to speak at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t even get me started on the ancient, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pocho.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/paracasskulls640.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paracas skulls from Peru&lt;/a&gt; .

Like this photo: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/pia17931-main_m34-sol528-wb.jpg&quot;&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/pia17931-main_m34-sol528-wb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Let it load. Just look at its stunning clarity. Now imagine the really good ones that they have held back, the ones of the ruined cities and structures that they have found. That&#39;s what I surmise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;But even on this image, let the file load and then scroll up and look at that range of hills in the background. In my browser, the slopes are covered with a light, greenish hue. Assuming this is not just an imaging artifact, then we may be looking at a vegetation cover. If so, that would mean that NASA is covering &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;up the discovery of life on Mars and only sending the &lt;/span&gt;Rovers to photograph barren, desert landscape, while keeping back the good stuff from public view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney Brown&#39;s Big Announcement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;I am not on the inside of&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://farsight.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Courtney Brown&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s big announcement that is coming up in about another month, or so.

I am enthralled by her life&#39;s work. Climbing up towering, sheer, cliff faces with your bare hands is the stuff of the deep dream state made flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You have to flow with the rock to do that or you are toast. Anyone can see that. I like her exploits because they anticipate in a sort of physical way the situation in which humanity now finds itself. The human race has very adroitly boxed itself into a most difficult pass, that scarcely admits of issue without something verging on planetary extinction. We have boxed ourselves in on all sides by towering cliffs of our own device -- ecological collapse, threats of nuclear war, nuclear apocalypse at Fukushima, dying oceans, unbelievably corrupt global financial systems, unbelievably corrupt government, runaway environmental degradation and more. Our prospects for survival much beyond this century look bleak. We are going down, baby, and hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Unless a way out can be found. But how to find that way out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It seems to me that the only way out is to go deeply within, and merge with the inscrutable recesses of the Universal subconscious. We have to flow with the life force of Nature, like Catherine Destivelle flowing right up the sheer rock face of a towering cliff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We have to move into an entirely different state of consciousness that gets away from the insanity of genetic engineering, nuclear engineering, chemical engineering, computer engineering, political, economic and social engineering, and so forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We have to merge our consciousness into the deep well of the Universal life source and drink deeply from the revitalizing waters of All That Is. We have to get down into the deep racial memories that are stored in the DNA that programs the very foundation of our being. We have to dig into the unspeakably sacred, hyper-dimensional precincts of our eternal group and individual souls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We must do this, or we may well not make it. Consciously tapping the Universal subconscious is key to our salvation. Only a mastery of lucid dreaming, and fully conscious access to the deep theta and delta states of awareness by a LOT of us, will enable us to make the sorts of connections that will lead us out of the nested set of nasty predicaments in which we find ourselves. By deep theta and delta states of awareness I mean the brainwave states of approximately 8 Hz to 1 Hz. These are the states of awareness that most people access in the dreaming or deep sleep state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;But the task of those who would go deeply into conscious exploration and development of their total being requires the awakening of the ability to be fully aware while deeply asleep, as it were. A paradox, to be sure, but it is feasible. And those who can do that, can achieve extraordinary feats of tremendous benefit to all humanity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That is because when you bring the magic realm of the dream state into waking awareness, into the everyday context of daily life, you can rearrange the basic elements of ordinary life, like a small child playing with a set of tinker toys or Lego blocks. Skilled hypnotists use these &quot;dreaming&quot; or &quot;deep sleep&quot; states to program people to accomplish staggering mental and physical achievements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The alphabet soup agencies are well aware of everything I am saying and much more. The negative programming that those Dark Sorcerer&#39;s have imposed on humanity is ominously staggering. They&#39;ve used everything to do that -- religion, compulsory mass education, warfare, mass political movements, electronic mind control, television, movies, political and cultural propaganda, subliminal advertising, mass advertising, stifling legal and police systems, and Black Magic. The Dark Sorcerers have been at this for thousands of years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Their agenda is real clear. If we are to survive we must activate our own agenda, not to fight with them, but to simply fully realize our own potential, in order to come into our own as completely sovereign beings, flowing with the Universal life impulse, in cosmic harmony and equilibrium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Religion does not show you how to do that. School does not. University does not. The corporate job does not. Television hypnotizes people by the hundreds of millions and billions into a false reality and keeps them there. And so forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If you are going to go into and grow into deeper realities and the deep reality of your own being you are going to have to do it yourself. You will have to reprogram or counter-program your own life, your own mind, your own reality. You will have to groove your own subconscious to consciously awake in that magical, interior wonderland and then integrate that into everyday daily life, bring the Universal magic into the mundane reality of ordinary, daily life here on Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I advertise the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subliminalcookbook.com/subliminalcookbook.htm?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subliminal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvisionsubliminal.com/?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NVision Subliminal Slideshow Creator&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They offer the nuts and bolts tools to reprogram your subconscious and, thus, your life. Understanding that by the time you reach adulthood you have been barraged by negative subconscious programming for decades, every day, hour after hour, all day long, you have some serious work to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I have read that it takes about 120 days to begin to implant a new idea, belief or behavior into the subconscious. I take this is a general rule of thumb, a way of saying that if you want to change, more is required than simply making a conscious decision to do so. That&#39;s only a superficial first step. To really change you have to thoroughly groove the subconscious. That requires time and repetition, until the desired change settles deep down inside and takes firm root at the core level of your being. Then it manifests as a matter of course. It becomes a part of you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subliminalcookbook.com/subliminalcookbook.htm?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subliminal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvisionsubliminal.com/?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NVision Subliminal Slideshow Creator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; have everything needed to do this. All the instructions are included as to the appropriate frequencies, how to write your own affirmations. What to say and how to say it, how to construct your own slides, your own subliminal recordings with binaural beats or isochronic tones, and how to use them to move your awareness into the deep theta and delta states where you can access the profound states of consciousness that facilitate serious personal change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;This way&amp;nbsp; you don&#39;t have to run&amp;nbsp; off to a shadowy Institute or Academy with nebulous ties to the NSA, CIA, USSA Army Intelligence, the Mossad, MI-6, and so forth, because God knows, the consciousness expansion field is absolutely littered with &quot;ex&quot;-operatives for the espionage agencies. That&#39;s all part of the Dark Sorcerer&#39;s control system. It is very subtle and they are quietly waiting to suck you right in to their network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;But if you do it yourself, it&#39;s so much better in my view. Why do you need an &quot;ex&quot;-Intel operative to validate your personal spiritual and self-realization?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;In fact, you don&#39;t.

You are programming your own life and your own sacred life mission, using your own inner guidance, instead of being funneled along in a&amp;nbsp; system developed by an organization with &quot;informal&quot; (or formal?) ties to the compartmentalized world of black ops -- be they in the USSA, Britain, Israel, or elsewhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am sick of the CIA and NSA, the NRO, USSA Army Intelligence (I know, I know, that&#39;s an oxymoron) and the DIA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve absolutely had it up to here with the Mossad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;MI-6 makes me want to projectile vomit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Other countries have their own, similar versions of this espionage agency sickness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am sure a lot of my readers feel the same way.

It takes some time to read the material, download the software, get to know the software, write your scripts, record your subliminal tracks, and then work with them and the binaural beats and isochronic tones. But if you are serious about reprogramming your &lt;u&gt;self&lt;/u&gt; you will do these things, and you will devote a quality block of time everyday to this work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Donations and Tips &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you like the writing, ideas, thoughts and information in my blog, I do accept donations and tips. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for how to send a financial donation.

Is it a script that several decades ago reliably caused financial chaos and suffering and issued in a devastating Second World War, and that therefore is being implemented again, for the same reasons, only on an even grander scale, to create even greater financial chaos and suffering, to result in a World War that is even more destructive and murderous than the Second World War?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Is that one of the reasons that the vast majority of the trading on the world&#39;s exchanges is now managed by powerful banks of corporate computers running highly complex, statistical algorithms that buy and sell shares of stock at speeds that the human mind cannot comprehend? Have the machines been given free rein to crash the system just the way it was done in 1929? In other words, is what we are seeing consciously programmed into the system to ensure that the events of 1929 to 1945 are repeated, only with far more devastating effect, this time around?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I think so. I think we are seeing raw evil unleashed.There is real, calculated malice behind contemporary events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Technology has changed radically, there are three and one half times as many people in the world now as there were in 1929, the economy is far larger and more complex, and yet we are to believe that the stock market chart now, almost exactly mirrors the stock market chart in 1929?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We are to believe that that is due to mere chance, random coincidence?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;No, sir.

He was an aggressive, obnoxious, alcoholic, really foul mouthed, 30-year old. But he had an aptitude for advanced statistics and higher mathematics. In fact, he had an MS in applied mathematics and statistics and he wrote algorithms that were programmed into the brokerage&#39;s computers. That&#39;s the rule nowadays. The algorithms that the big financial houses use are quite complex and they determine what stocks and financial instruments are bought and sold, in what quantity, when and where, under what circumstances and how long they are held. Large trades are made in mere fractions of a second.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And men like my former acquaintance make this system go. Actually, they are just the peons, the programmers who are told what to do. They are given the game plan by other players higher up in the control hierarchy, or at least they are given the part of the game plan that they are to put into play, and they then make it so. They program the computers accordingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The entire global system is modeled in detail. Intricate multivariate analysis, that correlates reams of data from corporations, huge financial institutions, government agencies, spy agencies, scientific studies and more, is run through banks of super-computers. Everything is modeled and gamed and schemed, again and again, for maximum global profit, for maximum global destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Because we are dealing with malevolent, wicked entities at the top of the control structure who are larcenous beyond belief and whose blood lust knows no bounds.

That is what is driving the vicious take down of the whole of humanity and their consequent impoverishment. That is ultimately behind the preparations for martial law and fascist dictatorship in the USSA and other countries. That is what is behind the international chemtrail program. That is what is behind preparations for a probably nuclear, World War Three.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Evil run amok. And it&#39;s being directed from behind the scenes, by shadowy entities. I don&#39;t know if they are all human, or whether the ones who appear human, even are, in actuality, human beings, according to the ordinary acceptation of the word, &quot;human.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We are dealing with something truly malevolent and hard, and it does not mean well. If you look at the available evidence it trends in the direction of humanity&#39;s enslavement and/or extinction. And not in the far distant future. We are talking about events that are in motion right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I refer you to the ghastly, ongoing catastrophe at Fukushima, Japan. Or the rapidly developing, global police state. Or to the ever more oppressive and repressive, global, financial system. Or to the rampaging ecological crisis -- as dead zones appear in the seas, the oceans die off, and the great forests are cut down. And that is just part of what we are facing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This is all part of an unspeakably vicious plan that is being enacted on a global level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It also definitely has a personal dimension. Millions and millions and millions of people are being destroyed, right and left, in all sorts of ways, all over the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In my case, I have been jailed repeatedly for my anti-nuclear demonstrations. I have lost many thousands of dollars of foregone compensation as a result. I have been spied on, ostracized, evicted, fired, threatened, assaulted, almost killed, and crudely criticized. There are people who snipe and snip at me, and about me, behind my back. They say I have gone off the rails, that I am a mere shell of the man I could have been. That I have been led astray by my embrace of shamanic consciousness, drinking &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt; and communing with the Nature Spirits in the Amazon forest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Poor Richard Sauder, they say, such a sad case. If only he had stuck to researching &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddolanpress.com/book-rs1-hidden-in-plain-sight-beyond-the-x-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;underground and underwater bases&lt;/a&gt;. But then he went and &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protested against preparations for nuclear war&lt;/a&gt; at Minot AFB, in North Dakota, and got put in jail, and then he went down to South America and ended up in the Amazon communing with the Nature Spirits and totally lost it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;And they shake their heads. Some of them even write to me and verbally abuse me or threaten me. They tell me that I got what I had coming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I see this as yet one more manifestation of the outworking of the evil that is attacking this planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If we are to avoid a real, shooting nuclear war, a WHOLE LOT more people than just Richard Sauder and a paltry few others will have to stand up publicly and perform nonviolent actions of great valor, because the preparations for nuclear war are well advanced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If we are to avoid a catastrophic collapse of the biosphere on this planet a WHOLE LOT of people had better start communing with the Nature Spirits, and really soon. We are facing ecological Armageddon, if we as individuals and a species do not establish a conscious connection with the life essence of Nature on our home planet. If we do not do that, we do not have a future here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want To Earn Free Bitcoin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I  know the Bitcoin market is down again in recent days, mostly because of  the issues at MtGox.com. but I am not deterred. The price may go up and  down, but Bitcoin still has value. That&#39;s the bottom line for me. We are living in uncertain times, true enough, but we are still faced with the necessity to provide for our daily needs. Bitcoin happens to have monetary value as an alternative currency. It therefore has a certain financial utility and a growing market share, so I  will continue to accumulate Bitcoin and so can you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To start you need a Bitcoin address and digital “wallet” to keep your addresses. You can get a wallet and one or more addresses at &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinbase.com/&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/wallet&quot;&gt;Block Chain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The  following are some of the best free programs that I have so far  discovered. They all are either free to join, or have a free member  option. So you can begin to accumulate Bitcoin without paying anyone  anything. They each pay small, incremental amounts of Bitcoin. If you  can get referrals many of these programs will pay you a percentage of  your referrals&#39; activity. In that way, you can increase your rate of  Bitcoin accumulation. In the process of going to these various websites  you will encounter advertisements for other Bitcoin programs. There are  some programs that are worth your while and there are others that will  suck all your Bitcoin away and leave you with nothing. You will have to  use your own best judgement as to whether to participate or not. &lt;i&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Billions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a new program that already has more than 50,000 members and is  growing quickly. It is a more sophisticated website than the vast  majority of websites out there, and the program managers have an  ambitious development plan. It has a free membership option. If you can  get referrals in this one, it might possibly prove very profitable, if  the program continues to grow along with the burgeoning Bitcoin market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot;

The ordeal started just after dawn with the potion he gave me to drink and didn&#39;t let up until midnight or so. No doubt, I proved to be far more resilient and with a much stronger will to live than he anticipated. I also expect that there was substantial spiritual intervention on my behalf that he did not sufficiently anticipate either. As many of my long-time readers know, I lived with a shaman in the Ecuadorian Amazon for a solid year, and in my last days on the &lt;i&gt;finca&lt;/i&gt; with him I nearly met my end at his hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I won&#39;t go through all the grim details of the day and night of 29 December 2012, but by the time it was all over I was absolutely reeling, in deep physical and emotional shock, and near death. It was like living through a scene in one of those poorly acted, B-grade horror flicks that show on late night television. My battle for survival could be likened to the struggle of a drowning man, 200 feet underwater, with his lungs screaming for air, who can see the surface of the sea, far above, and who knows that if he can only hang on, and keep from blacking out, and keep struggling upward, upward, upward, just stay awake and keep moving  up and up and up to the surface where he can fill his lungs with air, that he will make it, if only he can hang on and keep moving up to the light and the surface.&amp;nbsp; I struggled for hours, in tremendous pain and confusion and shock, and finally it was over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It wasn&#39;t until much later that I began to come to terms with the reality that I had almost died, so harsh was the treatment that I endured. At one point the shaman came with a syringe and hypodermic needle and told me that he had to inject me. I was face down in the dirt beneath one of the houses on the &lt;i&gt;finca&lt;/i&gt;, immobilized, incapable of even rolling over at that point. I had my face turned to the side and could see the needle and syringe that he held in his hand by the light of the flashlight. I told him, &quot;No,&quot; that I did not want an injection, whereupon he proceeded to inject me anyway, against my will. With what, I could not say. Monkey piss? Cow urine? Weed killer? &lt;i&gt;Curare&lt;/i&gt;? You tell me, because I don&#39;t know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;My body was so traumatized afterward that I did not urinate for two days. I didn&#39;t defecate for four days. I had multiple, painful contusions, and actual bubbles on my skin due to the internal lesions that I sustained. The first day, I could not even roll over in bed unaided, so great was the pain and swelling. I could not independently stand up or walk. The thighs and core area of my body were laced with many welts. The nights were the worst. The pain did not begin to abate for about six to eight weeks, and though I still have some pain in my lower extremities, it is much less severe than one year ago. I can now stand unaided, and walk clumsily. But the feeling in my feet, ankles and calves still has not fully returned. After 13 months of rehabilitation I can now raise one toe out of ten, the big toe on my right foot. One down, nine to go. I will regain the full movement in my toes one by one. I can raise my right foot partially, and rotate the ankle, but it lacks normal strength. The ankle and foot are still weak. On the left side, I cannot yet raise the foot, or any of the toes, and cannot fully rotate the ankle. But that is coming along. I have much more feeling than I did a year ago, and at least some movement in the foot. Even though my feet and ankles are weak, unstable and lack normal, positive reactions, I can nevertheless walk, albeit slowly and awkwardly and always paying close attention to the conditions of the pavement. I have come a long way in the last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;A number of people have suggested that there may be a hidden hand in what happened to me, that one of the USSA government alphabet soup agencies may have some concealed involvement. I have considered that possibility and cannot say one way or the other. It is highly probably that my underground and underwater bases research, my blogging and my anti-nuclear activism have all put me on one or more &quot;watch lists&quot; of the DHS, FBI, CIA, DIA, NSA, etc. But would they go to the trouble to conspire with a shaman in the Ecuadorian Amazon to assault me? Maybe. One of my friends thinks the BATF was involved, that they are running some kind of operation in the Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Could be. I don&#39;t run in those circles, so who knows? In the province where I was living, the two USSA government agencies with contracts that I noticed were the Peace Corps and USAID. Both of these agencies are either known for, or suspected of, clandestine cooperation with the CIA in various operations over the years, for obvious reasons -- both agencies have personnel and/or operations and contracts in rural areas of developing countries. Like the area where I was living, for instance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Then, too, in the months before my assault, two &quot;ex&quot;-Army men came to the &lt;i&gt;finca&lt;/i&gt; to drink &lt;i&gt;malicagua&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/i&gt;. I actually do not know how &quot;ex&quot; they were, only that they both had some sort of tie with the USSA Army. This was not the only, or first time that I encountered the trail of USSA military involvement or interest, direct or indirect, in South American shamanism. The fact is that there is a sort of loose reconnaissance, if you will, of Amazonian shamanism by certain individuals and agencies affiliated with the USSA military. It is not benign, because the agencies and individuals themselves are not benign. The USSA military is a real serious force of deep darkness on this planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So was USSA Army Intelligence (I know, I know, Army Intelligence is an oxymoron) involved in what happened to me? Did someone affiliated with the USSA military send around a couple of &quot;ex&quot;-military operatives to lay the groundwork to bushwhack Richard Sauder?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I simply do not know. I can&#39;t rule it in or out. All I can say is that they were there and interacted with the shaman and also talked with me a little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;At the end of the day my two immediate objectives with specific regard to the attack against me are:&amp;nbsp; 1) to bring my assailant to justice and 2) to recuperate and heal emotionally and physically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As regards the first point, I have brought a criminal complaint against the shaman. I have retained legal counsel in Quito to assist me with the cumbersome justice system here in Ecuador. In order to successfully prosecute and bring the case to trial I will need to pay my attorneys several thousand more dollars. I have already paid them several thousands, but that is the nature of the world in which we live. Given the totality of my circumstances, It has been extremely difficult for me to raise all of the money. I have a pressing need right now for $3,000 to bring the case to trail. It is important, not just for me, but for others. Shamanic corruption is an ongoing issue in the Amazon. There are some really ugly and vicious crimes being committed, but there are very few arrests and convictions. People are intimidated into silence by the threat of retaliation, or for want of financial resources to retain legal counsel, or both. I am the rare man who has stood up and is struggling to address the corruption, by publicly bringing a criminal complaint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Won&#39;t you please help me in my pursuit of justice in the Amazon? I really do need your help and I am asking for it plainly.

I also am getting a full eight hours of sleep every night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I was hospitalized more than four months, but now that I am out of the hospital I am doing more and more work with subliminal suggestions and binaural beats and isochronic tones. I am endeavoring to reprogram my subconscious, the better to deal with the trauma I sustained and bounce back to some semblance of normalcy again. I am using the suite of products advertised at the top of this blog page. The material in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subliminalcookbook.com/subliminalcookbook.htm?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subliminal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvisionsubliminal.com/?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NVision&lt;/a&gt; permit the subconscious to be programmed in a manner that sets the conscious mind aside, out of the loop, into the background.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am going to be writing more about this in subsequent blog posts, but what it gets down to is that something like 90% percent of human life is actually programmed, determined, influenced, etc. by our subconscious, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; by the conscious mind. This flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but it nevertheless is the fact of the matter. For that reason, implementing any desired change in life -- like regaining the normal use of the feet, toes and ankles -- requires the active engagement of the subconscious mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;But how to pragmatically do that ? Well, it turns out you have to communicate directly with the subconscious and groove it with a new program that you insert, and overlay whatever programming glitch that may be there with a healing, integrative program. The&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subliminalcookbook.com/subliminalcookbook.htm?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subliminal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvisionsubliminal.com/?a=spondylus5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NVision&lt;/a&gt; are specifically developed to target the subconscious. It&amp;nbsp; takes some time, a&amp;nbsp; lot of repetition, and the correct technique. So I am working with this process and I am gradually progressing. I can discern a deep, slow change or turning at a more profound level of my being. It is hard to put into words, perhaps because the subconscious is more emotional, feeling and visual than verbal. It does respond to language, though it tends to be very childlike and literal in its level of understanding. That is why you use short, positive, direct, first person affirmations when programming the subconscious. It is very powerful, yet literal minded and childlike. So you keep it simple, direct, positive and personal. After awhile, after months of hearing the same thing over and over, the subconscious decides, &quot;O.K., there is a change in plan! S/he is really serious about this.&quot; And it begins to implement the new program, the more so as the instructions are being given in the Master&#39;s Voice, i.e., &lt;u&gt;your&lt;/u&gt; voice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;It turns out that your subconscious is always listening to you, listening for guidance and direction. Most people are ignorant and confused and so they naturally confuse their subconscious with a welter of confusing, ignorant signals, instructions, ideas, thoughts and commands, with the inevitable result that they lead massively dysfunctional lives. Look at the plague of crime, dysfunctional families, substance abuse, corrupt business and politics, absurd popular culture, and more. This is the product of faulty (or malicious) subconscious programming by individuals themselves, but also by Hollywood, religion, schools, corporations, government, the military, mass media, popular culture and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;On the level of nutrition, my lengthy hospitalization impressed on me anew the importance of a healthy diet. The quality and quantity of the hospital food was really deficient and I lost a lot of weight as a consequence. Since my release from the hospital I have put some pounds back on and regained quite a bit of strength. For years and years I have been a lacto-ovo-vegetarian, so I am sticking with that. It is an affordable diet that I can readily obtain in Ecuador and which keeps me in good health, with a good energy level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;My diet includes many whole foods, a lot of it raw. I eat the items listed below in plentiful quantities. There are some modern supermarkets in Ecuador of the sort that you see in the USA, notwithstanding I get a lot of my food at the traditional markets or smaller shops where &lt;i&gt;viveres&lt;/i&gt; are sold. The markets and smaller shops are part of Latin culture, and they also frequently have lower prices than the supermarkets for comparable items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:

tangerines and grapes, I usually eat the seeds, which are rich in vitamin B-17. I crunch them right up. I sometimes eat the seeds of the papaya, too, even though they are not very palatable, because they have potent medicinal properties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The diet seems to suit me, because I continue to heal, albeit at a slow pace. The doctors here have variously told me that the nerves repair at the rate of one millimeter, or alternatively, three millimeters per month. At any rate, nerve regeneration and/or repair is a very slow process, so given the extent of the physical trauma I endured I am not surprised to still be recuperating feeling, movement, flexibility and strength, more than a year after the assault. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want To Earn Free Bitcoin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I know the Bitcoin market is down again in recent days, mostly because of the issues at MtGox.com. but I am not deterred. the Price may go up and down, but Bitcoin still has value. That&#39;s the bottom line for me. So I will continue to accumulate Bitcoin and so can you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;To start you need a Bitcoin address and digital “wallet” to keep your addresses. You can get a wallet and one or more addresses at &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinbase.com/&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/wallet&quot;&gt;Block Chain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The  following are some of the best free programs that I have so far  discovered. They all are either free to join, or have a free member  option. So you can begin to accumulate Bitcoin without paying anyone  anything. They each pay small, incremental amounts of Bitcoin. If you  can get referrals many of these programs will pay you a percentage of  your referrals&#39; activity. In that way, you can increase your rate of  Bitcoin accumulation. In the process of going to these various websites  you will encounter advertisements for other Bitcoin programs. There are  some programs that are worth your while and there are others that will  suck all your Bitcoin away and leave you with nothing. You will have to  use your own best judgement as to whether to participate or not. &lt;i&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Billions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a new program that already has more than 50,000 members and is  growing quickly. It is a more sophisticated website than the vast  majority of websites out there, and the program managers have an  ambitious development plan. It has a free membership option. If you can  get referrals in this one, it might possibly prove very profitable, if  the program continues to grow along with the burgeoning Bitcoin market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot;

The present commercial banking system is so massively intertwined with the shadowy, deep politics of the American state and its alphabet soup agencies, in particular, and the shadowy, deep politics of other governments, and with the immensely lucrative, illicit, global narcotics industry, that its very survival depends on perpetuating the enormously corrupt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin profoundly threatens all of that, because it is not tied to the central bank controlled system of global finance. Rather, it represents an eminently viable, global, decentralized alternative to that system.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;And don&#39;t be fooled – many trillions of dollars are on the line. One of the most informative videos I have seen on what is happening in the realm of global finance is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QK4bblyfsc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;interrogation of the Inspector General of the US Federal Reserve Bank by U.S. Congressman Alan Grayson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;. In response to his questioning she disavows any knowledge of the disposition of the staggering sum of $9 trillion dollars on the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank&#39;s ledgers. That is more than  the 2012 $8.23 trillion national gross domestic product of China. Clearly the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank&#39;s Inspector General knows where $9 trillion have gone and who or what has the money and what is being done with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The amounts of money are so large, and the stakes for global power politics are so great, that the major power brokers will not easily permit the entry of a new, and unorthodox player such as Bitcoin to reform or overturn their extremely corrupt and ruthless game.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Can Bitcoin be used by nefarious, criminal elements? Of course it can, and has been. That said, the crack down by police authorities, especially in the USA, has less to do with protecting the public from drug dealers and money laundering, than it does with protecting the massive, global, criminal racketeering that the American government and other governments, and the “too big to fail” banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, are so heavily involved in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There is a global “official” mafia and it will vigorously protect its turf against all comers. Nevertheless, since its birth a few years ago Bitcoin has made impressive headway, against formidable odds. In spite of everything, Bitcoin persists, demonstrating determined staying power.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot; style=&quot;font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;I am therefore bullish on Bitcoin and see a promising future for it. The old power structure is weakening and crumbling from its own internal, corrupt dynamics. Bitcoin is the new kid on the block, and stands poised as a logical successor to play a uniquely important role in the development of the next stage in the economic life of global humanity. A flurry of recent Bitcoin acceptance by a variety of major businesses such as Overstock.com, Las Vegas, Nevada casinos, the Sacramento Kings professional basketball team and more indicate that Bitcoin continues to gain market share, with the prospect of even more impressive growth ahead of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How To Get Some Bitcoin of Your Own&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;To start you need a Bitcoin address and digital “wallet” to keep your addresses. You can get a wallet and one or more addresses at &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinbase.com/&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/wallet&quot;&gt;Block Chain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The following are some of the best free programs that I have so far discovered. They all are either free to join, or have a free member option. So you can begin to accumulate Bitcoin without paying anyone anything. They each pay small, incremental amounts of Bitcoin. If you can get referrals many of these programs will pay you a percentage of your referrals&#39; activity. In that way, you can increase your rate of Bitcoin accumulation. In the process of going to these various websites you will encounter advertisements for other Bitcoin programs. There are some programs that are worth your while and there are others that will suck all your Bitcoin away and leave you with nothing. You will have to use your own best judgement as to whether to participate or not. &lt;i&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Billions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a new program that already has more than 50,000 members and is growing quickly. It is a more sophisticated website than the vast majority of websites out there, and the program managers have an ambitious development plan. It has a free membership option. If you can get referrals in this one, it might possibly prove very profitable, if the program continues to grow along with the burgeoning Bitcoin market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbillions.com/?refid=18ykVMEw4DE4UK9CtF78AbMs3KN783m1kC&quot;

			<p><a href="http://themoneyparty.org./main/">Michael Collins</a><br /> <img class="quote_left" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/ep5-1.jpg" border="0" /><br /> <span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Fiction delivers justice that reality rarely approaches.&nbsp; Victims endure  suffering and emerge as victors after overcoming incredible  challenges.&nbsp; Stieg Larsson&#8217;s gripping <a href="http://dragontattoofilm.com/">Millennium Trilogy</a> weaves a story of revenge and triumphs for Lizbeth Salander, locked  away in a mental institution and sexually abused for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">When  Salander got out and threatened to go public about a high level sexual  exploitation ring, the perpetrators sought to lock her up again.&nbsp; In the  final installment, <em><a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/movies/29girl.html">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet&#8217;s Nest</a></em>, Salander found some justice. (<a href="http://dragontattoofilm.com/">Image</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Susan Lindauer&#8217;s autobiography, <em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/23qqjpw">Extreme Prejudice</a></em>,  tells a story with certain broad similarities.&nbsp; In her case, however,  the hornet&#8217;s nest kicked back with a real vengeance.&nbsp; After over a  decade as a U.S intelligence asset, Lindauer was privy to information  about pre-war Iraq that threatened to serve up a huge embarrassment to  the Bush-Cheney regime.&nbsp; She hand delivered a letter to senior Bush  administration officials in hopes of averting what she predicted would  be the inevitably tragic 2003 US invasion of Iraq.&nbsp; Those officials,  unnamed in the indictment, were her second cousin, then White House  chief of staff Andy Card, and Colin Powell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">After the invasion failed to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD),  Lindauer went to Congress offering to testify about the quality of  prewar intelligence. In early 2004, she met with staffers in the offices  of Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Trent Lott (R-MS) in February 2004.&nbsp;  Shortly after those visits and other offers to testify in public,  Lindauer was indicted on March 11 for serving as an &#8220;unregistered agent&#8221;  for pre war Iraq and promptly arrested.&nbsp; .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>The Crime That Wasn&#8217;t</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">And what did Lindauer do as an alleged unregistered foreign agent, a  charge the government was never willing to try in open court?&nbsp; According  to then U.S. District Court Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who handled the  case for a period, the &#8220;high-water mark&#8221; of government&#8217;s case was based  entirely on the letter that Lindauer delivered to her second cousin,  then White House chief of staff, <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2002Q4/war.html">Andrew Card</a>.&nbsp; Lindauer had written Card on at least ten other occasions since the 2001 Bush Inauguration.&nbsp; She wrote:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Above all, you must realize that if you go ahead with this  invasion, Osama bin Laden will triumph, rising from his grave or  seclusion. His network will be swollen with fresh recruits, and other  charismatic individuals will seek to build upon his model, multiplying  those networks. And the </em><em>United   States</em><em> will have  delivered the death blow to itself. Using your own act of war, Osama and  his cohort will irrevocably divide the hearts and minds of the </em><em>Arab   Street</em><em> from moderate governments in Islamic countries that have been holding  back the tide. Power to the people, what we call &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; will  secure the rise of fundamentalists.</em>&#8221; &nbsp; <a href="http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/0710/LindauerToCardLetterJan2003.pdf" target="_blank">Susan Lindauer&rsquo;s last letter to Andrew Card, January 6, 2003</a> in <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0710/S00266.htm" target="_blank">American Cassandra: Susan Lindauer&rsquo;s Story, Oct 17, 2007</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">This letter was based on extensive contacts with Iraqi diplomats at  the United Nations in New York and a prewar trip that she took to Iraq  with the knowledge&nbsp; of her intelligence handlers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Before she could stand trial, in 2005, Judge Mukasey accepted the  opinions of court appointed experts that Lindauer might be delusional  and ordered her locked her up for an extended psychiatric evaluation and  observation.&nbsp; She was placed in the Carswell federal prison facility at  the very secure Carswell Air Force Base in Ft. Worth, Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Mukasey&#8217;s conclusion was contradicted by evidence not considered (see  below) covering fourteen months (March 2004-April 2005) of court  ordered evaluation and psychological services in Maryland that  consistently reported that Lindauer was functioning well and not  delusional.&nbsp; The order allowed 120 days, the legal maximum detention  period.&nbsp; She was at detained for seven months at Carswell and another  four months in a Manhattan lockup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">When Lindauer refused to take strong psychotropic medication as part of her evaluation, Assistant US Attorney <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2008/09/15/can-he-stop-troopergate.html">Ed O&#8217;Callaghan</a> sought a court order from Judge Mukasey to force the medication on her  either orally or by injection.&nbsp; Remarkably, it appears that Mukasey was  not informed that the professional staff at Carswell had <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0809/S00157.htm">recommended against forced medication</a>.&nbsp;  Based on his detailed opinion and order of September 6, 2006 denying  the Assistant US Attorney&#8217;s request, Mukasey was also not aware of  direct evidence from Carswell professional staff that Lindauer&#8217;s  behavior was well with the normal range, particularly considering the  circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Five years after her indictment, Susan Lindauer never got the trial  she repeatedly requested.&nbsp; On September  15, 2009, Assistant US Attorney  O&#8217;Callaghan convinced US District Court Judge Loretta Preska that  Lindauer was not mentally competent to stand trial.&nbsp; Judge Preska <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0901/S00210.htm">dismissed the case</a> at the request of O&#8217;Callaghan&#8217;s replacement on January 15, 2010.&nbsp; This was done against Lindauer&#8217;s wishes and ignored <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0806/S00263.htm">credible witnesses</a> who testified to her role as an intelligence asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Lindauer&#8217;s&nbsp; second attorney, Brian Shaughnessy, a former federal prosecutor in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sirica">Judge John J. Sirica&#8217;s</a> court and distinguished Washington, DC defense counsel, noted that this  was the only case that he&#8217;d ever heard of in which prosecutors argued  that a defendant was mentally incompetent to stand trial</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">O&#8217;Callaghan went on to serve as legal advisor for then Governor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7618524.stm">Sarah Palin&#8217;s scandal defense team</a> in Alaska.&nbsp; Judge Preska <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2008/09/bush-nominates.html">received an appointment</a> from President Bush to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  six days before ruling that Lindauer was incompetent to stand trial.&nbsp;  Andy Card pursued a successful career in the private sector.&nbsp; And Colin  Powell retained is good name and status despite misleading the United  Nations about Iraq&#8217;s alleged chemical weapons programs and his active  participation in &#8220;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/5es872">choreographed</a>&#8221; torture sessions for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and lesser known detention venues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Despite her efforts and willingness to go public for the benefit of  the country, Lindauer was systematically attacked by the federal  government and denied her repeated requests for an open trial in federal  court.&nbsp; For her, there were no movies or best sellers, no award or  promotions, and no happy endings.&nbsp; She was left at the side of the road  with only her story and evidence to challenge the charges that the  government steadfastly refused to try in open court for over five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Lindauer&#8217;s case was so strong that her second and final attorney, Brian Shaughnessy, took the extraordinary step of <a href="http://extremeprejudiceusa.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/brian-shaughnessy_attorney_affidavit1.pdf">issuing a statement</a> that her claims were supported by the extensive evidence that he  reviewed.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;I &hellip; assure you that Ms. Lindauer&#8217;s story is  shocking, but true.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an important story of this new political age,  post-9/11.&#8221;&nbsp; Her uncle, <a href="http://extremeprejudiceusa.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/thayer_lindauer_affidavit.pdf">attorney Thayer Lindauer</a>, offered an affidavit on his research which confirmed Lindauer&#8217;s role as a US intelligence asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>What Were They Trying to Hide and How Did They Hide It</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Lindauer&#8217;s career as a US intelligence asset and back channel to Iraq first came to light in 1998.&nbsp; She released <a href="http://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0007_me2.htm">an affidavit</a> for the Lockerbie bombing trial recounting information provided to her by the man she described as her <a href="http://extremeprejudiceusa.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/thayer_lindauer_affidavit.pdf">CIA handler</a>, <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/lockerbie.html">Richard Fuisz</a>.&nbsp; The claim was that the bombings were carried out by <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975399,00.html">Syrian operatives</a>, not the accused Libyans.&nbsp; Given Fuisz&#8217;s reputed high level intelligence skills, this was a <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/lockerbie.html">major event</a> covered in the press.&nbsp; Despite the publicity and controversy  surrounding the affidavit, Lindauer&#8217;s association with Fuisz continued.&nbsp;  She was never charged or even reprimanded by the government for her  role in the affair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">But when Lindauer was willing to go public with her work on Iraq with Fuisz and another reported intelligence handler, <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKhovenP.htm">Paul Hoven</a>,  she was indicted for giving one letter to Andrew Card, a letter which  proved to be very much in line with of the best advice the Bush  administration received on the ill conceived, deadly invasion and  occupation of Iraq.&nbsp; That was what the administration was so intent on  hide hiding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The information Lindauer would have released, as told in <em>Extreme Prejudice</em>, concerned her work with Fuisz in the <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0806/S00263.htm">months prior to 9/11</a> in which Fuisz and his team provided early warning about the attacks on  the World  Trade Center.&nbsp; She would have revealed Iraq&#8217;s willingness to  turn over terrorists to the FBI and about her contact providing  &nbsp;information on al Qaeda&#8217;s financial structure and funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The vehicle to silence Lindauer was the indictment as an unregistered  foreign agent, despite the flimsy basis for the charge.&nbsp; Once indicted,  the newly crafted Patriot Act was the clincher.&nbsp; The act allows charges  to be levied without specifics listed in an indictment or known to the  defendant.&nbsp; In fact, under the act, the defendant&rsquo;s attorney may not  have access to the charges unless certain security requirements are met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">In Lindauer&#8217;s case, her attorney had a secret briefing with US  intelligence officials.&nbsp; Just as the Patriot Act allows, the occurrence  and the content of that meeting were never revealed to Lindauer. &nbsp; Her  first attorney, Samuel Talkin, had a met with US intelligence officials  shortly after the defense psychologist, Sanford L. Drob, PhD, conducted a  two hour interview with Lindauer (report reviewed by the author)..&nbsp; A  few days after the Talkin-US intelligence meeting, Drob recommended a  defense based on mental incompetence.&nbsp; The meeting between her first  attorney&#8217;s and US intelligence officials was revealed to Lindauer only  years later by her second counsel, Brian Shaughnessy, who obtained the  information through pre trial discovery motions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>Psychiatric Set Up and Tear Down</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The full spectrum tear down of Lindauer relied heavily on highly  selective psychiatric testimony from several court appointed  psychiatrists in Manhattan.&nbsp; None of these psychiatrists ever treated  Lindauer.&nbsp; They all interviewed her in a forensic setting, which  typically drastically limits understanding an examinee&#8217;s mental state in  politically charged contexts where the examinee is not cooperative.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Worse, the forensic experts hired by the state in such contexts often  act as &#8220;hired guns,&#8221; and typically refuse to consider independent  substantive evidence that supports the examinee&#8217;s claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">By her report and the author&#8217;s review of interview transcripts  provided by her attorney, Lindauer was not once cooperative with the  court appointed forensic examiners.&nbsp; The dialog between her and  psychiatrist Stewart Kleinman, MD, the most influential expert, was  caustic and devoid of substantive content.&nbsp; Linder repeatedly stated  that she didn&#8217;t want to be interviewed by Kleinman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">In essence, the court experts routinely refused to follow up with  witnesses Lindauer offered to attest to her role as an intelligence  asset and to confirm her activities related to Iraq.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Most telling, the experts, upon whom Judge Mukasey relied for his  confinement of Lindauer and his later opinion on forced medication,  failed to consider the twelve month record of evaluation and counseling  treatment after her arrest.&nbsp; Psychiatrist Dr John S. Kennedy, MD of  Maryland concluded that her:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">&#8220;&hellip; thought content was free of hallucinations, delusions,  homicidality, or suicidality. She expressed confidence in an acquittal.&nbsp;  Judgment and insight were fair.&nbsp; Cognition was grossly intact. &hellip; I don  not believe there are grounds for a psychosis diagnosis.&#8221;&nbsp; March 13,  2004</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Lindauer attended 35 hours of counseling sessions between March 2004 and April 2005.&nbsp; You can examine <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2czmhs4">the notes</a> yourself provided by Lindauer and a part of her legal defense documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">There is a consistent pattern of assessed psychological stability in  every single monthly summary.&nbsp; A frequent theme is expressed over time  is that Lindauer, &#8220;appears to maintain psychological stability and shows  no sign or symptom of mania or psychosis.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her treatment was  concluded on April 7, 2005 with the note, &#8220;So far she has shown no signs  of mania or depression and any symptoms of psychosis that would require  additional intervention.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">This information was not seriously considered or, more likely,  completely ignored by the New York court appointed &#8220;experts&#8221; who labeled  her delusional for maintaining her innocence.&nbsp; In addition, never  mentioned in court proceedings was important evidence from Carswell  psychiatric nursing reports.&nbsp; These <a href="http://tinyurl.com/24seeqf">reports document</a> a consistent pattern of positive behavior and no signs of  hallucinations or delusions during confinement.&nbsp; The Mukasey ruling of  September  6, 2006, well referenced with the court expert opinions,  makes no mention of Dr. Kennedy&#8217;s evaluation, the 35 hours of counseling  provided in Maryland, or the Carswell nursing reports.&nbsp; This was highly  relevant primary evidence by clinicians familiar with Lindauer&#8217;s day to  day and week to week behavior over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">As she tells it convincingly in <em>Extreme Prejudice</em>, Lindauer  had to be silenced.&nbsp; First she was defamed publicly as someone who had  worked for Iraq.&nbsp; Then she was diminished by the selective analysis by  court appointed psychiatrists which further negated her story.&nbsp; Like the  current <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-fg-assange-legal-20101208,0,5899444.story">Wikileaks</a> controversy over Julian Assange, the delivery of bad news for those in  power in the White House resulted in a figurative order to <em>shoot the messenger. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><em>Extreme Prejudice</em> is memoir, action thriller, and cautionary  tale on the risks citizens take when they go too far, know too much, and  offer to tell the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">END</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Disclosure:&nbsp; Lindauer based a chapter of <em>Extreme Prejudice</em> on an unpublished paper I wrote on the relationship between 9/11 and the Iraq war.&nbsp; I received no compensation for this.</span></p>

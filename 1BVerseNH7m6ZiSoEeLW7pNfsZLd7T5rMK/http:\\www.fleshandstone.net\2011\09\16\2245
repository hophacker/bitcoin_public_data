			<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/lucywhitecom.jpg" border="0" /><br /> <em>Wall Street and the big banks owe $1.5 trillion for the bailout (at  least).&nbsp; The Super Congress needs to cut $1.5 trillion over ten years.&nbsp;  Get the money from Wall Street and cancel the Super Congress.&nbsp; Problem  solved. </em></p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s debt ceiling <em>crisis</em> was resolved when Congress and the Obama administration <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=2545">made a deal</a> to cut&nbsp; <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">trillions </span>in  federal spending over the next ten years.&nbsp; Congress identified the easy  cuts, the low hanging fruit so to speak, for a total of nearly $1.0  trillion.&nbsp; At the same time, Congress and the White House created the  &ldquo;Super Congress&rdquo; committee of six senators and six representatives  charged with cutting another $1.5 trillion. (<a href="http://lucywhite.com/">Image: Lucy White with permission</a>)<br /> <img class="mceWPmore" src="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /><br /> The committee has unparalleled power to draft legislation, without the  normal legislative processes of debate, deliberation, modification, and  amendments.&nbsp; If seven of the twelve committee members vote in favor of  the budget cutting legislation by the <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">November</span> 23 deadline (see chart in appendix III), the bill will be submitted to  the entire Congress for an up or down vote.&nbsp; The bill will not be  subject to any modification or change.&nbsp; Debate will be very limited. (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.00365:">Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction</a> <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:5:./temp/%7Ec112PWNJqZ:e62731:">Text</a>-<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s365enr/pdf/BILLS-112s365enr.pdf">pdf</a>)</p>
<p><strong>A Lose&ndash;Lose Deal for Citizens</strong></p>
<p>The Super Congress committee is a lose-lose deal for citizens.&nbsp; If  the committee produces legislation that is passed into law, that law  will be based on a violation of any number of democratic processes.&nbsp; If  the committee fails to produce legislation then watch for another round  of downgrades from the credit rating agencies that brought us the real  estate bubble and the economic collapse.</p>
<p>The legislation that created this committee surrenders unrestrained  authority to the committee of twelve. This excludes the input and votes  of the remaining Senators and members of the House of Representatives in  the process of cutting the federal budget.</p>
<p>The goal is to improve the economy and help citizens.&nbsp; It will do  neither.&nbsp; By cutting government spending this way, the bill will  inevitably take money out of the economy and cost jobs for public  employees and government contractors.&nbsp; Cutting benefits, it will also  harm citizens by reducing their ability to access basic services.</p>
<p>A majority of the House and Senate voted to create this committee, a  compromise between the White House and reactionary leadership in the  Republican and Democratic parties.</p>
<p>Did we elect these people to create illogical, harmful legislation as  a solution to the crisis that many of them created in the first place?</p>
<p>We live in a world where public servants assume the role of  autocratic masters without any regard to the realities of our current  situation.&nbsp; The people are reduced to mere spectators watching the  elected <em>in crowd</em> accumulate yet more power and operate without citizen input.</p>
<p><strong>The committee is stacked to protect the status quo</strong></p>
<p>The status quo is quite simply the following:&nbsp; corporate subsidies;  ongoing bailouts for Wall Street; endless war; and, the unrestrained  growth of the national security state.&nbsp; None of this is <em>on the table</em> for the vaunted Super Congress.</p>
<p>The committee was appointed by the Democratic and Republican leaders  in the United States House of Representatives and Senate. One line of  reasoning argues that the six to six split of Republicans and Democrats  is a formula for stalemate. A more cynical view is that there is a  &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; on the Democratic side who will vote with the highly  conservative Republican faction. A third outcome is that there is an  underlying unity on the committee. This will lead to a compromise  &#8220;sacrifice&rdquo; that will appear to be across the board but, In fact, favor  those at the very top of the economy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some evidence of political philosophy according to the  voting records of the committee members. Republican members include  Senators Kyl (AZ), Portman (OH), and Toomey (PA). The Republican  Representatives are Camp and Upton (MI) and Hensarling (TX). Democratic  Senators include Baucus (MT), Kerry (MA), and Murray (WA). Democratic  Representatives are Becerra (CA), Clyburn (SC), and Van Hollen (MD).</p>
<p>Using the decades old <a href="http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/2010.pdf">Americans for Democratic Action</a> (ADA) ratings and those of the <a href="http://www.conservative.org/congress-ratings/">American Conservative Union</a>,  we see a strong ideological split. Each organization rates members of  Congress on a set number of bills each year to determine their loyalty  to liberal or conservative causes. The ADA ratings for the 2nd session  of the 110th Congress, 2010, shows the Super Congress Democrats with  very liberal ratings averaging 93% (range, 85-100%). The Republicans  scored higher on the ACU scale averaging 96% (range, 88-100%)</p>
<p>The supposed ideological strength on each side of the committee  represents the argument for deadlock. The liberal&ndash;conservative divide  will play out in the committee, the argument goes, and there will be no  legislation.</p>
<p>The jaundiced view assumes a <em>ringer</em> among the Democrats,  someone who will give in to heavy cuts in Social Security and Medicare.  While Senator Baucus shows strong support for banking and corporate  interests and might be pegged as the cross over vote, he strongly  opposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare suggested by Obama&#8217;s  deficit reduction commission chairs (see <a href="http://baucus.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=244">December 2, 2010</a>).</p>
<p>A better method of analysis involves looking at the crucial votes by  members, the votes that got us into trouble with the federal debt.</p>
<p>The Iraq war and the Wall Street bailouts are the twin pillars of our  current troubles. According to figures from the 2012 US Budget (Office  of Management and Budget), the total cost of the Iraq was through 2010  was <strong>$6.1 trillion </strong>(<a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/09/06/911-and-the-War-on-Terror-A-5-Trillion-Choice.aspx#page1">see graph here</a>).&nbsp;  Imagine the impact of $6.1 trillion worth of support for Social  Security and Medicare, repairing infrastructure, and deficit reduction.</p>
<p>The cost of the bailouts is still being racked up. The SourceWatch <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Total_Wall_Street_Bailout_Cost">Wall Street Bailout table</a> shows that $4.7 trillion disbursed, $3.2 trillion was <em>repaid</em>, and $1.5 trillion is still outstanding.</p>
<p>Support of <a href="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/?page_id=17">The Money Party</a> agenda of endless war and bailouts <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18231330">for the wealthiest</a> institutions and individuals represents the essence of our budget  troubles. Liberal and conservative voting records are meaningless unless  those voting are graded on their efforts against the wholesale looting  of the US Treasury.</p>
<p>The real rating scale for members of the Super Congress committee is  their record on the Iraq War authorization and the 2008 bailout that  created a river of cash for Wall Street. Eight members were in lock step  support of the Iraq War and the bailouts. Two opposed the Iraq war very  early, Murray and Van Hollen. Hensarling, the Texas Republican, voted  against both bailout bills in the House. Becerra was at zero for The  Money Party opposing both the war and both House bailout bills (<a href="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/?page_id=2674">See voting record chart</a>).</p>
<p>The committee members are ten to two in favor of bailouts and nine to  three in favor of Iraq. Why should we expect anything to come out of  this process other than a reaffirmation of the status quo?&nbsp; War and  bailouts (corporate subsidies) will be left alone. It&#8217;s a stacked deck.  These legislators delivered before, they&#8217;ll deliver again. They know who  they work for. The best we can hope for is a deadlock and no action.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a solution</strong></p>
<p>The Super Congress committee is tasked with reducing the national debt by $1.5 trillion over <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ten</span> years.&nbsp; The Wall Street crowd owes Treasury and the Federal Reserve  $1.5 trillion for the bailout (Appendix I).&nbsp; Give them three years to  pay it back.&nbsp; Conduct a comprehensive audit of supposed repayments to  date and add any shortages.&nbsp; Apply that amount to the deficit and there  is no need for a Super Congress to denigrate democracy, harm citizens,  and engage in revolting histrionics on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; The ten year goal  of $1.5 trillion would be taken care of in three years with no threat to  Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>This type of solution explains why Congress and the White House  created the tightly structured Super Congress in the first place.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  The Money Party protection racket in full swing.&nbsp; Set up a needless  goal, bar any discussion of real solutions, and make the public pay for  it.&nbsp; Same as it ever was&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Appendix I</strong></p>
<p>Bailout recipients owe the US Treasury about $0.5 trillion and the  Federal Reserve another $1.0 trillion.&nbsp; That money should go directly to  the deficit reduction, eliminating the charade of the Super Congress.&nbsp;  The Fed put out <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Total_Wall_Street_Bailout_Cost">$4.0 trillion</a> to save Wall Street and the big banks. It has nearly $3.0 trillion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Net_worth">assets</a>.&nbsp;  It can afford this with the right structure or the system can just  consider it a franchise fee.&nbsp; If the Fed can&rsquo;t handle it, Congress can  legislate it out of existence and create a Bank of the United States or a  <a href="http://neweconomyworkinggroup.org/sites/default/files/LiberateAmericaONLINE.pdf">network</a> of 50 <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/the-north-dakota-miracle-not-all-about-oil">state banks</a> with a limited Fed for the money supply.&nbsp; The assets of a truly national bank would make it viable instantaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Appendix II</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Super Congress Proxy Voting is Unconstitutional</strong></p>
<p>Deliberative assemblies in representative democracies have one common  characteristic: equality of membership.&nbsp; The elected representatives  act as a body to create and deliberate bills that become national law.&nbsp;  Not just some of the representatives, all of them take part in this  process before a bill becomes law.</p>
<p>When a very few assume the tasks of the many in an assembly, namely  the twelve members of the Super Congress committee, the net result is  the ceding of deliberative and voting power from the many to the few.&nbsp;  That is called proxy voting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fine for shareholder meetings but not  a representative democracy.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order is clear on proxy voting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;It is  unknown to a strictly deliberative assembly, and is in conflict with the  idea of the equality of members, which is a fundamental principle of  deliberative assemblies. There can be but little use for debate where  one member has more votes than another, possibly more than all the  others combined.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.constitution.org/rror/rror-08.htm">Roberts Rules of Order</a></p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t find proxy voting allowed anywhere in the Constitution.&nbsp;  The authorizing legislation was illegal as is any legislation that may  flow from the committee since it entails proxy voting.</p>
<p>But this is how they have to do business.&nbsp; The budget cuts  forthcoming will be so painful and unpopular, the legislature, as a  whole, is afraid to have roll call votes to make them accountable.&nbsp; They  need the cover of a contrived national emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Appendix III</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Super Congress Timeline</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> The Congressional Budget Office told Congress that it needed legislative  proposals weeks earlier than the initial schedule above.&nbsp; That will  shorten the Super Congress deliberation process significantly.&nbsp; <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-13/politics/deficit.commission_1_debt-ceiling-deficit-commission-deficit-reduction?_s=PM:POLITICS">CNN September 13</a> Didn&rsquo;t the bill authors talk to CBO before they put together this  timeline?&nbsp; This is another example of how ridiculous this process is.</p>

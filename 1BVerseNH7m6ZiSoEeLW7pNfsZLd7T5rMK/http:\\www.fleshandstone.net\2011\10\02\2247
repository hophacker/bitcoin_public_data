			<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) just issued an <a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/resources-and-documents/materials.html">environmental report</a> on its enhanced security plan to cover an area extending from the East  Coast to the West Coast, from the northern border of the United States  to 100 miles south of the border. While there are few specifics on the  new security measures, the environmental report offers enough to see how  we will be <em>protected</em> against threats to national security  coming from Canada. The Department of Homeland security will enhance  efforts and technologies to reduce the danger from &#8220;known terrorist  affiliates and extremist groups [that] have an undisputed presence along  the Northern Border in both the United States and Canada.&#8221; <a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/resources-and-documents/materials.html">Northern Border Security Programs, p. 1-3, September 2011 (Northern Border)</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thelastminute/4361155300/">Image: thelastminute</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">In 2006 the American Civil Liberties Union exposed the expansion of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security_technology-and-liberty/are-you-living-constitution-free-zone">border control</a> activities to within 100 miles of any point on the U.S. border. ACLU labeled this area the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/constitution-free-zone-map"><em>Constitution Free Zone</em></a><em>. </em>Search  and seizure options at border checkpoints are not constrained by the  Fourth Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which protects against  unreasonable search and seizure. Now, thanks to the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), just because they&#8217;re within 100 miles of the  nearest border nearly 200 million citizens are subject to searching and  procedures that previously were used exclusively at border checkpoints.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/Optimized-bordermounties.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><em>Photo courtesy Duncan Rawlinson, lead instructor at <a href="http://www.photographyicon.com/" target="_self" title="photographyicon.com">PhotographyIcon.com</a>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><strong>What do they have in store for citizens on the northern border?</strong><br /><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></span><span style="font-size: small;"></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">Some  highlights of the program include: checkpoints far from the border (but  within the 100-mile limit); increased patrol activity; remote video  surveillance system systems; upgraded surveillance and  telecommunications systems; high-powered X-ray machines of various  kinds; and fencing or vehicle barriers at selected points along the  border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">The new and improved &#8220;High-Energy X-Ray Imaging Scanners&#8221; (<a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/images/stories/docs/02-proposed-action-and-alternatives.pdf">Northern Border, p. 2-12</a>)  expand national security radiation exposure from airline passengers to  the much broader audience of drivers and their families, for example,  who choose to visit and return from Canada, as well as those who choose  to visit the United States from Canada, and anyone unlucky enough to  drive into a checkpoint in the <em>Constitution Free Zone.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">Buried  within the report was this findings, DHS asserts that even though  &ldquo;exposure to high levels of radiation would increase a person&rsquo;s  probability of developing cancer and hereditary genetic damage,&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/images/stories/docs/08-environmental-consequences.pdf">Northern Border, 8-13-10, p. 201</a>),  the impacts of this program will be &ldquo;negligible.&rdquo; One wonders if their  analysis has considered the kids sitting in the back seat of the car,  protected by nothing more than that back seat and their clothing, while a  CBP agents X-rays the car&rsquo;s trunk with a mobile device. It&rsquo;s hard to  feel warm and fuzzy about impacts being negligible when you can&rsquo;t see  any analysis to support that assertion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">With the expanded  territory and array of new technologies, one can argue that the security  measures represent a militarization of the Canadian border. The  following illustration from the environmental report makes that point:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/finalgraph.gif" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/images/stories/docs/01-introduction.pdf">Northern Report, 1-6</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">The  possibilities for a one-sided encounter with those who claim to protect  us are endless. You may be driving to visit a friend in a car once  owned by someone one on the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/border-security-technologies">Automated Targeting System (ATS)</a>, &#8220;a security and tracking program for cargo that DHS has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extended to travelers</span> by assigning all who cross the nation&#8217;s borders with a computer-generated <em>risk assessment</em> score that will be retained for 40 years &#8212; and which is secret and  unreviewable.&#8221; A Homeland Security drone spots you and relays the  message to the Customs and Border Protection command center. That alert  sends a message to the &#8220;mobile data terminal&#8221; in a Border Patrol &#8220;agent  vehicle&#8221; and it&rsquo;s game on. You&#8217;re pulled over. Good luck explaining why  you&#8217;re in a &#8220;dirty car.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><strong>O Canada!</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">&#8220;CBP  (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) is the largest law enforcement  component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It has a  priority mission of keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the  United States.&#8221; <a href="http://www.northernborderpeis.com/images/stories/docs/01-introduction.pdf">Introduction, p. 4</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">&nbsp;An  enhanced security zone along the longest peaceful border in the world  should raise suspicion. As Paul Craig Roberts has pointed out, there  have been no successful terrorist attacks on the United States since  9/11, at least none conducted by foreign governments (arguably, the  response to Hurricane Katrina can be seen as a <em>de facto</em> terror  attack on the people of New Orleans). There were two cross-border  threats intercepted in December, 1999 through the efforts of Customs and  Border Protection agents and others at the Canadian border in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3nrnzx9">Vermont </a>and <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2001-06-26/justice/millenium.terrortrial_1_bomb-plot-abdel-ghani-meskini-ressam-s-montreal?_s=PM:LAW">Washington state</a>. But that was with the systems and technologies of that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">Has  Canada suddenly become a hotbed of virulent anti-American activity? Are  the Mounties and other law enforcement agencies in Canada turning a  blind eye to known threats? Are we expected to believe that the nation  that turned down a featured role in the <em>coalition of the willing </em>has suddenly become lax on enforcing international law?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><strong>Keeping them out or us in? (Or is it all about the money?)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">Is there another motive behind the seeming militarization of the Canadian border</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">My  choice for primary motive is enhanced revenue opportunities for the  defense and national security industries.&nbsp; The U.S.-Canada border is  over 4,000 miles long. The opportunities of a 100-mile ribbon along that  border are expanded by all those people living there, approximately 50  million. This could be a huge payday. After all, Iraq and Afghanistan  must end at some point. What better project to take up the slack for  defense industry taxpayer subsidies than a massive border build up in  areas that provide safe working conditions?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">Look how quickly the government <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/criticism-dhs-deploy-full-body-scanners-us-airports/story?id=11680506">deployed full body scanners</a> in airports across the country after the <em>underpants</em> bomber affair. Even though <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Scanners--The-Prequel-by-Michael-Collins-101118-678.html">highly reliable witnesses</a> saw that bomber bypass a security check at his point of departure,  Amsterdam, the administration and security experts acted like a scanner  would have somehow prevented events that had <a href="http://dailycensored.com/2010/01/08/conspiracy-or-cock-up-white-house-reaction-to-ersatz-bomber/">nothing to do</a> with any type of security check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">The  absurdity of government policies on war, defense spending, and the  economy, and the elimination of more and more constitutional and other  protections, opens the door for more sinister interpretations. There  will be speculation that just maybe, the financial elite who run things  see a total collapse of the economy. They should know, they created it.  Or maybe they see a total loss of rights and an end to the pretense of  freedom. Instead of letting all those <em>consumers</em> (aka citizens)  cross the border in search of a reasonable life, they may just want to  keep us around for the next big holiday shopping spree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">The border  security program as prison bars for citizens is far-fetched but,  arguably, it is no more far-fetched than a plan to beef up the border  with a friendly, cooperative neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">We live in a time of great  decline. The cause of that decline is the ownership of virtually all of  the tools of political control by those whose sole motive is to make  more money than the huge sums they&#8217;ve already accumulated. For positive  change to become an alternative, those who have failed so miserably need  to be sent packing, replaced by true servants of the people.</span></p>

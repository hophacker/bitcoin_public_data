<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/murdochhunt.jpg" border="0" /> When things don&#8217;t work out, doing business with Murdoch can be the kiss of death.</p>
<p>No matter how hard you try, how loyal you are, if something goes wrong, you can be sure it will be your fault.</p>
<p>Reporting  has failed to lay the proper foundation for understanding Rupert  Murdoch&#8217;s remarkable testimony before the Leveson Inquiry in London and  his behavior of late.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch is a nihilist.</p>
<p>Murdoch&rsquo;s  television outlets in the United States stoked the fires for the 2003  invasion of Iraq based on outrageous misrepresentations like the idea  that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The war cost  tens of thousands of dead and seriously injured U.S. soldiers, <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/press_releases/2006/burnham_iraq_2006.html">several</a> hundred thousand <a href="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ORB_revised_iraqi_deaths_2008.pdf">dead</a> Iraqi civilians, and $3 trillion. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/acb/5956033360/">Image: acb</a>)</p>
<p>Last  summer, Murdoch went full throttle to support Republicans in the U.S.  Congress as they fabricated a debt ceiling crisis that seriously damaged  the credit rating of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Murdoch&rsquo;s  support of the Tea Party created an utterly irrational voice in U.S.  politics that prevents even the most modest necessary reforms. Created  by right wing lobbyists, this pseudo party blocks every vital project,  from reviving the economy to an effective, coordinated response to the  crisis created by climate change.</p>
<p>In the nations occupied by his multinational media empire Murdoch takes the path of maximum damage to the public and governance.</p>
<p>It was appropriate for the House of Common&#8217;s culture, media, and sport committee to find <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/may/01/rupert-murdoch-not-fit-select-committee"><em>Rupert Murdoch &#8216;not fit&#8217; to lead major international company</em> (May 1).</a></p>
<p>Where  were they and the majority in Parliament over the past three decades  while Murdoch exceeded all limits or propriety and civility, trashed the  political system in Great Britain and elsewhere, and dragged down the  level of public dialog and governance to record lows?</p>
<p><strong>Called to account by the Leveson Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/">Leveson Inquiry </a>(the  inquiry) was established on July 13, 2011, just nine days after the  Guardian&#8217;s Nick Davies broke the story of Murdoch&#8217;s tabloid <em>News of the World </em>hacking  the voice mail of deceased kidnap victim Millie Dowler. Prime Minister  David Cameron had no choice but to bow to a furious public and appoint  an inquiry.</p>
<p>Headed by the distinguished jurist <a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/people/lord-justice-leveson-chairman/">Lord Justice Brian Leveson</a>,  the inquiry is examining &#8220;the culture, practices and ethics of the  media.&#8221; It seeks to answer the question &#8220;Who guards the guardians?&#8221; The  inquiry began hearing testimony in November 2011.</p>
<p>It was just last summer that Rupert and son <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/21/james-murdoch-select-committee-evidence">James</a> testified confidently before a House of Commons committee. The  Murdoch&#8217;s seemed in control of the MPs, many of whom had spent years  groveling before Murdoch and his News Corporation media executives.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s Leveson Inquiry hearings were entirely different. Father and son Murdoch were questioned for hours by a <a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/people/counsel-to-inquiry/">professional prosecutor</a>.  Unlike the July 2011 appearance at the House of Commons committee,  their testimony was integrated with substantial evidence, carefully  gathered and presented to the public before the hearing. The Leveson  Inquiry produced a <a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Exhibit-KRM-18.pdf">160-page pdf of emails</a> featuring Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, and Frederic Michel, News Corporation&#8217;s ubiquitous lobbyist.</p>
<p>What did we learn about Murdoch&#8217;s treatment of the British people and system of government?</p>
<p>The  high points were Murdoch&#8217;s show of contempt for the political process  and of his hyper focus on obtaining approval for the acquisition of  remaining shares of the BSkyB (Sky) pay TV network. News Corporation  already owned a controlling interest in Sky, 39%. (For the importance of  the Sky acquisition, see <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Rupert-watch--signaling-t-by-Michael-Collins-120422-72.html">Rupert watch &#8211; signaling the end, Michael Collins</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Contempt for the political process</strong></p>
<p>Murdoch  installs and topples British governments at his discretion using the  power of his media properties. Despite steadfast support for PM Tony  Blair and New Labour for over a decade, Murdoch switched his allegiance  to David Cameron&#8217;s Conservative Party in 2010. That change was a major  factor in the defeat of Blair&#8217;s successor, then-PM Gordon Brown.</p>
<p>David  Cameron&#8217;s public courtship of Murdoch was without shame. In May 2007,  as Conservative opposition leader, the future PM hired <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015573/Rebekah-Brooks-vetoed-BBC-man-told-Cameron-No10-job-Andy-Coulson.html">Andy Coulson</a> as Conservative Party communications director at the suggestion of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/29/rebekah-brooks-andy-coulson-leveson-inquiry">Rebekah Brooks</a>, a Murdoch insider and executive. Coulson was former <em>News of the World</em> editor who was up to his neck in phone hacking, about which he misled Parliament&#8217;s early inquiries. (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/apr/24/leveson-inquiry-jeremy-hunt">Guardian timeline</a>)</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/1884401/Bloated-BBC-out-of-tough-with-the-viewers-says-Tory-chief-David-Cameron.html">November 2008</a>, Cameron wrote a column for Murdoch&#8217;s favorite tabloid, <em><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/">The Sun</a></em><em>, </em>attacking  BBC&rsquo;s leadership and its licensing fee. He said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s become bloated  with many of its executives overpaid.&#8221; He also insisted on reduction of  the fee, a move that would curtail BBC revenues and the network&#8217;s  ability to compete with Murdoch&#8217;s media proerties.</p>
<p>A few month later, in <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/07/David_Cameron_People_Power_-_Reforming_Quangos.aspx">July 2009</a>, Cameron gave a major policy speech in which he set his sights on Murdoch&#8217;s number one regulatory nemesis, <a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/public-interest-test-nov2010/">Ofcom</a>,  the British media regulatory agency. Cameron signaled to Murdoch what  would happen to Ofcom and the identity of the Conservative MP likely to  become secretary of culture, media, and sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeremy Hunt has concluded that OFCOM currently has many other responsibilities that are matters of public policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;So with a Conservative Government, OFCOM as we know it will cease to exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The  attack on BBC and plan to strip Ofcom of its powers, placing them in  the hands of a sympathetic cabinet secretary (&#8220;Jeremy Hunt has  concluded&#8221;) were Cameron&#8217;s way of saying that he would play ball with  the head of News Corporation. It was part of Cameron&#8217;s public audition  for a role as a highly placed lackey.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt made a fateful visit to News Corporation headquarters in New York City in August, 2009. He said he spent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2135100/Jeremy-Hunt-held-meetings-News-Corp-day-trip-U-S-decided-bid-BSkyB.html">five days studying local television</a>.  Last week Murdoch testified that at this time he and son James were  fine tuning the decision to buy the remainder of Sky shares.</p>
<p>Did Hunt indicate that a Cameron government would green light the Sky acquisition at the New York meeting?<br /> <img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/murdochjameslaughs1.jpg" border="0" /><br /> Shortly after Hunt&#8217;s mission, James Murdoch, then chairman of Sky, met  with Cameron, promising Murdoch support for Cameron&rsquo;s bid to become  prime minister. Cameron did become prime minister after he formed a  coalition government in May 2010. He appointed Hunt secretary of  culture, tried to pair back Ofcom, and froze BBC&#8217;s licensing fee for  several years. As inquiry evidence showed, Hunt delivered on the biggest  action item &#8212; support for News Corporations acquisition of the  remaining shares of Sky that it didn&#8217;t already own.</p>
<p>Extensive  email evidence shows that after Cameron assumed power, a robust back  channel opened up between News Corporation&#8217;s lobbyist, Frederic Michel,  and Hunt&#8217;s man at Culture, Media and Sport, Adam Smith.</p>
<p>The  incriminating emails start in June 2010 and run through February 2011.  Smith provided a blow-by-blow description of Hunt&rsquo;s efforts as well as  previews of upcoming decisions. Michel fed Smith instructions and got  confirmation when they were implemented.</p>
<p>Fast forward &#8212; April 29, 2012. <em>The Independent</em> ran this headline:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-hunt-on-the-brink-as-he-is-accused-of-misleading-parliament-7687530.html"><strong>Exclusive: Hunt on the brink as he is accused of misleading Parliament</strong></a></p>
<p>From  evidence and testimony by Rupert and James Murdoch last week, it is  abundantly clear that Hunt concealed his agent relationship on behalf of  News Corporation. The culture secretary withheld evidence from  Parliament as illustrated by the emails presented before the Leveson  Inquiry. Those emails were not in his submission to Parliament.  Nevertheless, they exist.</p>
<p>PM Cameron is also in hot water for not  appointing an independent investigation of Hunt. After the testimony and  evidence of last week&#8217;s hearings, there is zero doubt that Hunt is a  bad actor. The worse he looks, the more pressure will mount on Cameron  to justify his failure to investigate Hunt&#8217;s failures.</p>
<p>Fly too close to the media Sun King and your wings melt, then you crash and burn.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron&#8217;s kiss of death</strong></p>
<p>Jeremy  Hunt&#8217;s position is simply indefensible. He withheld evidence in his  possession, evidence critical to Parliament&rsquo;s responsibilities. The  evidence (emails) showed up at the inquiry last week.</p>
<p>When the  evidence of Hunt&#8217;s agent role for Murdoch came out last week, Hunt  appealed to Lord Justice Leveson for an earlier appearance at the  inquiry to clear his name sooner. The inquiry issued a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17877149">statement</a> saying that &#8220;in the interests of fairness to all&#8221; there would be no  change in the schedule. Why? Because the inquiry is not about  ministerial conduct, Hunt&#8217;s or that of any other Cameron minister.</p>
<p>As  clear as this statement from the Leveson Inquiry was, Cameron continues  to insist that the inquiry is the best forum to evaluate Hunt&#8217;s  actions. This signals the beginning of the end for Cameron. He&#8217;s  proposing a solution for the Hunt investigation that is outside the  rules of Parliament in a forum that has rejected him. Upon closer  examination, existing evidence will lead to even stronger condemnation  of Hunt&#8217;s behavior. Any new materials produced by the inquiry will bury  him.</p>
<p>Where will that leave Cameron?</p>
<p>Finished!</p>
<p>Doing business with Rupert Murdoch is the kiss of death.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Addendum: Smoking emoticon ?</strong></p>
<p>This  interesting exchange occurred during testimony by James Murdoch under  questioning by Queens Council (QC) Robert Jay last week (<a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-24-April-2012.pdf">Afternoon hearing, James Murdoch, April 24</a>).&nbsp;  QC Jay noted that the email (below) from News Corporation lobbyist  Frederic Michel to James&nbsp; indicated that &#8220;absolutely illegal&#8221; behavior  was employed to get government plans regarding the Sky acquisition.&nbsp;  James brushed this off with a smile claiming that the greater than  symbol and explanation point indicated that &#8220;it&#8217;s a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Q. Robert Jay, QC: Look at the email on page 54, 01695, in the middle of the page, January, Mr Michel to you: (below)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/murdochemailillegal.gif" border="0" width="492" height="196" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Exhibit-KRM-18.pdf"><em>Leveson Inquiry, Evidence, Rupert Murdoch, Exhibit-KRM-18.pdf</em></a><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></em><a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/305589-3"><em>Video: James Murdoch, Part 3, 54:00</em></a><em> </em><a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-24-April-2012.pdf"><em>Transcripts: Page 39-40; pdf page 10</em></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A.  James Murdoch: I thought it was a joke. I think the little &#8212; the  &#8220;greater than&#8221; and the exclamation point there, or wink &#8212; it&#8217;s a joke.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Q. Robert Jay, QC: Is it? It was absolutely illegal in one sense. It&#8217;s completely unethical, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>What  emoticon is Murdoch talking about? The email above is a copy of an  email sent from Michel to James Murdoch. James Murdoch says that the  symbol &gt;! is a &#8220;joke&#8221; or indicates a &#8220;wink.&#8221; The following  combinations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons#Common_western_examples">supposed emoticon</a> written by the Murdoch lobbyist don&#8217;t seem to exist: &gt;! &#8211; &gt;!] &#8211; ..&gt;!]</p>
<p>The  alternative explanation is more consistent with the behavior brought  out by the Leveson Inquiry. QC Jay is correct. The text and symbols  refer to &#8220;absolutely illegal&#8221; behavior. In light of that, Frederic  Michel&#8217;s symbol ..&gt;!] may be a means of exclaiming the highly illegal  method of acquiring the information from the government source.</p>
<p>Was <em>absolutely illegal</em> phone hacking employed to obtain information from the offices of Jeremy Hunt or other Cameron ministers?</p>

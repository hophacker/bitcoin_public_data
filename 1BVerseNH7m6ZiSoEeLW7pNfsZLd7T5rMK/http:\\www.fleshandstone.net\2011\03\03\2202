			<p><strong><em><a href="http://themoneyparty.org/">By Michael Collins</a></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The  International Monetary Fund (IMF) made an embarrassing error just two  days before the start of the Libyan people&#8217;s revolution on February 17.&nbsp;  This quote from an IMF country study appeared in a <a href="http://economicpopulist.org/content/gaddafi-regime-collapses-people-hold-line-despite-brutal-attacks">previous article</a>: &#8220;<em>The outlook for </em><em>Libya</em><em>&rsquo;s economy remains favorable.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2011/pn1123.htm">IMF Feb 15</a> </em>This  advice was 180 degrees off target.&nbsp; The Libyan economy has ceased  functioning as protests and popular demands imploded the Gaddafi regime.  (<a href="http://rochester.indymedia.org/newswire/display/26836/austin.indymedia.org">Image</a>)<em> </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Further investigation unearthed a specific pattern of positive IMF  endorsements for each of the nations experiencing popular uprisings that  are sweeping the region.&nbsp; When the IMF blesses a nation&#8217;s progress for  conforming to the economic policies underlying globalism, watch out!  There is a popular rebellion in the wings.</span><img class="left_image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/imftxt.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="138" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The Allied powers created the IMF in 1944 as a &#8220;<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/exrp/differ/differ.htm">cooperative institution</a> that seeks to maintain an orderly system of payments and receipts between nations.&#8221; &nbsp;The original entity was known as the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/about/histcoop.htm">Bretton Woods Agreement</a>.&nbsp;  The US dollar, tied to gold, became the standard for international  trade.&nbsp; The agreement claimed to promote open global trade and economic  liberalization through IMF loans to nations to increase the volume of  global trade, i.e. globalization.&nbsp; The US has led the organization since  its inception.&nbsp; In 1971, President Nixon removed the gold standard for  the US dollar.&nbsp; Shortly after Nixon&#8217;s move, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/about/histend.htm">members</a> developed their own exchange arrangements in the context of IMF goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">There are numerous criticisms of the IMF on the <a href="http://clogic.eserver.org/2004/hill.html">left</a> and <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1997/05/bg1113-the-international-monetary-fund">right</a>.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/3/structural-adjustment-a-major-cause-of-poverty">continued impoverishment</a> of participating nations that were supposed to grow economically is the  baseline critique.&nbsp; IMF does not seem to help much, unless one  considers debt-laden governments a sign of progress.&nbsp; In essence, the  loan program moves in to shore up nations devastated in the various  shocks to the world economy from oil price increases, financial crises,  etc., and, ironically, problems from following IMF recommendations. For  the masses, the IMF is like the corner man for beaten down fighter who  refuses to throw in the towel.&nbsp; For the autocrats in charge, it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund#Support_of_military_dictatorships">regenerating pot of cash</a> at the end of the rainbow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>IMF Scorecard in </strong><strong>North Africa</strong><strong> and the </strong><strong>Middle East</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><img class="left_image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/imf8.png" border="0" width="432" height="187" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">IMF was wrong on <strong>Libya</strong>, as we have seen.&nbsp; On the date of their  report, February 15, &#8220;the outlook for Libya&#8217;s economy&#8221; was anything but  favorable.&nbsp; The nation was two days away from the current people&#8217;s  revolution, which devastated the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">IMF said the following of <strong>Egypt</strong> before its revolution:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">&#8220;The  government&rsquo;s FY2009/10 fiscal deficit target of 8.4 percent of GDP is  expected to be met on the strength of careful fiscal management. If  revenues perform better than expected as a result of strengthening  activity, it would be prudent to save these.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/021610.htm">February 10, 2010</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">As though torture, political suppression, severe anti union policies,  and the mass of people seeing their income buy less and less made no  difference, IMF was bullish on Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">IMF was also high on <strong>Tunisia</strong> just before that revolution took place:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">&#8220;Executive  Directors noted that Tunisia weathered the global crisis well, largely  reflecting its sound macroeconomic management and structural reforms  over the last decade, and timely policy responses since the onset of the  crisis. &hellip;&nbsp; Amid continued uncertainties for the external environment,  they [IMF Directors] emphasized the need to maintain macroeconomic  policies that support the recovery and to intensify structural reforms  that would enhance competitiveness, diversify exports, and promote job  creation.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2010/pn10121.htm">September 1, 2010</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Weeks before the great Tunisian uprising, IMF says that Tunisia came  through the global recession and emerged on a sound footing.&nbsp; This point  was missed by&nbsp; the Tunisian people. Inspired by a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/201111684242518839.html">street vendor</a> who chose to self-immolate rather than endure any more of the regular  indignities by the state bureaucracy, Tunisians went to the streets  demanding the removal of the government.&nbsp; They chased off their dictator  but resistance remains as strong for those who oppose reform.&nbsp; The  &#8220;structural reforms that would enhance competitiveness&#8221; were not for the  majority.&nbsp; They benefited the despot, former dictator <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4thhz7o">Ben Ali</a>, and his cronies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>Yemen</strong>, on the southern border of Saudi Arabia, is the <em>perfect </em>client state for IMF assistance.&nbsp; Due to a decline in <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2010/pr10419.htm">oil revenue</a>s, the nation faced serious economic challenges.&nbsp; IMF moved in to <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/country/notes/yemen.htm">offer advice</a>, which entailed reducing fuel subsidies; tightening tax code enforcement; and, &#8220;containing nonessential current expenditures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The reductions in fuel subsidies were substantial, 10%, angering the  people.&nbsp; The increases for&nbsp; social support were modest.&nbsp; IMF got it all  wrong when it concluded:&nbsp; &#8220;The program is off to a good start. A number  of important policy measures have been implemented to address fiscal  imbalances.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/country/notes/yemen.htm">IMF, August 19, 2010</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Yemen has seen massive anti regime demonstrations over the past two  weeks.&nbsp; The most prominent demand is the removal of the autocrat, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129112626339573.html">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a>,  who has ruled since 1978.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the initial protests at the end of  January, the anti regime movement has backed the long-standing ruler  into a corner.&nbsp; Abdullah Saleh is now <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/spotlight/yemen/2011/02/20112279236457898.html">losing support</a> from his remaining stronghold and may be gone soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">IMF sees the <strong>Oman</strong> as a very safe bet for success due to &#8220;sound  macroeconomic management.&#8221; Long one of the favored developing nations,  the IMF said the main risk to Oman was from falling oil prices, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/121810.htm">IMF said</a>.&nbsp; Oil prices were up significantly when major protests broke out in this model economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">On <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201131101527815578.html">March 1</a>,  Aljazeera reported that, &#8220;The demonstration was&nbsp;organised by  intellectuals and non-governmental associations and protesters  held&nbsp;placards reading &#8216;We want jobs&#8217;, &#8216;We want higher salaries&#8217; and &#8216;We  want freedom of the press&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">The revered Oman represents another IMF predictive failure, as does <strong>Bahrain</strong>, the site of a resistance movement that faced down <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4s36rjt">murderous attacks</a>.&nbsp; Prior to the protests, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2009/pn09112.htm">IMF extolled</a>, &#8220;the Bahraini authorities&rsquo; prudent macroeconomic policies and strong financial oversight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><strong>Who Benefits?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;"><img class="right_image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/imfdictators.png" border="0" width="383" height="374" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Oman, and Bahrain&nbsp; had two things in  common prior to the popular uprisings.&nbsp; They alligned with the fiscal and  economic policies of the IMF and autocrats were in charge.&nbsp; If you are  an autocrat, dictator or strongman in charge of a nation of any size, you  have to love the IMF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">They come into the country and&nbsp; establish financial criteria. These  strictures don&#8217;t harm you, the dictator, one bit.&nbsp; You get loans and  favorable trade agreements.&nbsp; Cooperation with IMF globalization is the  ticket to a series of big paydays.&nbsp; You get current and&nbsp; future rake  offs for you and your cronies, and nobody at IFM complains.&nbsp; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund#Support_of_military_dictatorships">Data for graph</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Then you get to buy weapons and other goods that are totally useless  to your citizens. That turns into another source of payoffs and  enhanced personal income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Your people live in a state of existential dread&nbsp; if you add  unfulfilled dreams to the material deprivation.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re looking good  to IMF and, as a result, your personal fortune grows.&nbsp; Just play ball  with the big boys and it&#8217;s a never ending holiday for you and your  friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">How much more of this IMF success package can the people of the world endure?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br />N.B. Two days after <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4hmo4pk">this article</a> was published including the IMF Feb 15 statement that,&nbsp; &#8220;<em>The outlook for Libya&rsquo;s economy remains favorable, &#8220;</em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/6y8fugo"> an IMF representative admitted</a> that the <em>sustainability </em>of <em>macroeconomic </em> gains required a more inclusive participation by a nation&#8217;s population.   One wonders when IMF will issue an apology to all of those who have  suffered under the dictators IMF has propped up over the past several  decades?</span></p>

<p>National School Chaplaincy/High Court Challenge Update:</p>
<p>This is urgent. It would be great if everyone could get behind this today and promote it to your own networks. This is the time to mobilise folks.</p>
<p>The Federal government announced last night they are going to pass legislation to circumvent the High Court ruling on funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program. This is a cynical, underhanded move which, I imagine, won’t impress the High Court at all. It is not at all clear that this attempt to snub the ruling won’t end the government back in the High Court, but we have to wait to see their legislation first.</p>
<p>What we can do immediately, although it won’t overturn the legislation, is try to get the Greens to stand up in Parliament and oppose it – or at least demand amendments to the program. This will get publicity about what is going on and shine a spotlight on what the government is doing. But we need *you* and your networks to help.</p>
<p>As a matter of urgency, please send an email to the following list:</p>
<p>senator.milne@aph.gov.au, adam.bandt.mp@aph.gov.au, senator.dinatale@aph.gov.au, senator.hanson-young@aph.gov.au,<br />
senator.ludlam@aph.gov.au, senator.rhiannon@aph.gov.au, senator.siewert@aph.gov.au, senator.waters@aph.gov.au, senator.wright@aph.gov.au, senator.whish-wilson@aph.gov.au</p>
<p>Here is a sample letter. You can use your own words if you like, but please use the three dot points as they appear so we present a cohesive message.</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Funding – National School Chaplaincy Program</strong></p>
<p>Dear Senators and Mr. Bandt</p>
<p>You will be aware the ALP are planning to rush legislation through parliament to subvert the High Court decision in Willams v the Commonwealth and Ors.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for the Greens to hold the government to account. The High Court has made a ruling which provides a greater level of public accountability and now the ALP – undoubtedly with the support of the coalition – intend to circumvent that ruling through legislation.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for the Greens to make a public stand for some incredibly important issues, including public accountability, separation of church and state and our children’s right to a secular public education system.</p>
<p>I would be grateful if the Greens would represent my views in respect to this matter. They are as follows:</p>
<p>1) I do not support the Howard-Gillard program that supplies chaplains of any faith in Australia’s public schools, and I urge you to prevent the continuation of chaplains in today’s forthcoming legislation.</p>
<p>2) If we are to have Commonwealth assistance supplied to schools in this manner then I am firmly of the view that they must be fully qualified as school counsellors, which means they are qualified teachers with a degree in psychology and postgraduate qualifications in school counselling, and nothing less can do.</p>
<p>3) It is time to stop outsourcing this work to third party contractors and these fully qualified school counsellors must all be employed as public servants in the relevant Education departments in each state and territory in order to ensure some high level of confidence in their training, integrity and the outcomes.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>————————————</p>
<p>Fellow bloggers – can you please consider reblogging this – either cut and paste this post or rephrase as you see fit, but please keep the three dot points intact.</p>

				<p>The Classification board is taking comments on the Terms of Reference for the upcoming Classification Review.</p>
<p>You can read about it here: <a href="http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.classification.gov.au']);">Classification website</a>. You can also submit your comments on line.</p>
<p>My submission:</p>
<blockquote><p>With regard to the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the review of the classification in Australia, I would like to make the following comments:</p>
<p>The ToR seems to be based on the old-media view of the world &#8211;  the use of the terms &#8220;industry&#8221; and &#8220;content and distribution industry&#8221;. Whilst a review of &#8220;industry&#8221; is warrented it is apparant from the experience of the internet that an increasing amount of content is user generated (think blogs, youtube etc). Distribution becoming end user to end user, rater than content producer to distributer to end user.  The ToR does not take this into account. </p>
<p>The ToR does not not specify a review on whether classification is warrented (or appropriate) at all in the 21st century, or is appropriate for citizen to citizen communtication (think user generated content above).</p>
<p>The ToR does make reference to classification schemes in other juristictions, but does not specify if Australia should regognise classifications from country-of-origin (with the view to reduce classification costs, prevent doubling-up).</p>
<p>regards,<br />
Lucas James</p></blockquote>

				<p>ACT Senator Kate Lundy (ALP) is <a href="http://www.katelundy.com.au/2009/12/21/further-thoughts-on-the-filter/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.katelundy.com.au']);">getting more feedback</a> on the <a href="http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/115" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au']);">ill conceived internet censorship policy</a>. Her original <a href="http://www.katelundy.com.au/2009/12/17/my-thoughts-on-the-filter/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.katelundy.com.au']);">blogpost</a> was informative, as was all the feed back given.</p>
<p>One thing that stood out was her understanding that the <strong>mandatory nature</strong> of the censorship proposal was a election promise, and the subsequent objections were a mere misunderstanding of the promise.  </p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, there was an ambivalent reaction to the policy at the time of the election policy because it was not understood to be a mandatory filter for the general population.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the wording of the under-reported policy doesn&#8217;t support her understanding.  We got exactly the meaning of the promise. </p>
<p>The offending wording is (from <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/download/now/labors_plan_for_cyber_safety.pdf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.alp.org.au/download/now/labors_plan_for_cyber_safety.pdf']);">this ALP policy document from 2007</a> on page 5):</p>
<blockquote><p>A Rudd Labor Government will require ISPs to offer a ‘clean feed’ internet service to all homes, schools and public internet points accessible by children, such as public libraries.</p></blockquote>
<p>The use of the word &#8216;offer&#8217;, combined with &#8216;accessible by children&#8217; would indicate it was very optional to childless homes, and optional to all areas.</p>
<p>I do understand the drafters may have <strong>intention</strong> of having mandatory, but the wording doesn&#8217;t bear that out.  It may be the usual political use of weasal words to prevent them from being pinned to what they said, but unfortunately it has backfired.</p>
<p>I do hope that the good Senator does listen to the people she is supposed to represent, and vote against this policy.  Both in the Labor caucus, and on the Senate floor (regardless of caucus outcome). I for one will not vote for, or give preferences to the ALP if this policy comes into effect.</p>

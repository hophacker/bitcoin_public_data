Sam serves as the captain for the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League (WHL) and was recently selected 2nd overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. We'll talk to Sam about his junior carrer with Kootenay, his family life and what's it's like to come from hockey bloodlines and playing International hockey and representing Team Canada. The interview is sponsored by CCM and the new CCM Tacks. One of the most storied and celebrated skates ever introduced is returning to Source For Sports&reg; shelves this summer after a 10-year absence. Months of rumors and speculation, including pictures leaked from NHL superstar Nathan MacKinnon, have led to a launch date of July 18, 2014. Before his match up against the New Jersey Devils on February 3rd, MacKinnon made the news official by posting a picture of the sleek new boot to his Twitter account. The skate will come equipped with some new revolutionary features that will immediately contribute to players' on ice performance. The new CCM AttackFrame quarter package has the lightest fibre reinforced boot to ever hit the market. This new feature will suit players looking to increase explosive acceleration and stability. Additional components such as a 4.0 speed blade holder and hyper glide runner will supply more gliding ability to help maintain speed after quick acceleration. Next, Kevin Allen from USA Today helps us recap a busy week in the NHL. With the NHL draft in the books, we've turned the corner onto free agency. We take a look at all the NHL teams and how they faired in going after some of the top NHL free agents. The first two days of NHL free agency were as wild as predicted. Ninety-six players were signed for a combined $543 million Tuesday, with the average annual salary being $2.8 million. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming up today on NHL On the Ice will be a replay of last weeks interview with Sam Reinhart.

Ironically, wars are most often fought for access to fossil fuels. Dependence on them may be our undoing. Fittingly, the military uses a greatly disproportionate amount of these fuels to keep the war machine going. Halting climate change is integral to ending war. The problem is more complicated than most people realize. Unless you have done some serious research, it is much more dangerous than you know. There is good reason to think that we are on a course to extinction of the human race. Multiple positive feedback loops appear likely to cause global climate catstrophe much sooner than we have been led to believe. Human civilization hangs in the balance. Billions will die for decisions we have already allowed others to make. However, if we can build a united international front against fascism and war to challenge the war profiteers, we will have the strength to do what can be done to assure the survival of civilization. This is the end of the world as we know it. What comes next is up to us.

By taking a glimpse into the Garden of Eden, we can see God's original intention for men, women, and their partnership with one another. We can understand the differences between the genders and how we were made different on purpose, for a purpose. Discovering this divine purpose is even more fascinating when you see how it is supported by brain science, relationship research, as well as the principles and fundamentals of psychology and sociology. Want to see what the Bible truly reveals about being a wife and a husband? Join us as we dive into a totally new way of understanding the relationship between the sexes with relationship expert Jennifer Miller. She will be sharing insights from her new book, "No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage." Before and after the show, please post your questions and comments for Jory and Jennifer on Jory's Facebook Business Page. Jennifer Miller is a Christian pastor, professional counselor, and author who has dedicated her career to helping individuals, couples, and families strengthen their faith and their relationships.Her new book, ?No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage,? is a compilation of all the wisdom she has gained and shared over the years on what truly makes relationships work, as well as how to communicate across the gender gap. It reveals new insights into how men and women think and behave, while also guiding you to understand what the Bible truly has to say about you and marriage. In addition to teaching and writing on marriage and family topics, she serves as the Co-Executive Director of The Center for Living Well, a nonprofit Christian wellness ministry, based in Phoenix, Arizona with divisions in both Canada and Michigan. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if a man and woman becoming one is not a commandment, but really how God created us to function best?

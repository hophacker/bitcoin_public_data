<p><a name="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></p>

<p>If the performance of the game seems too slow, or the game is failing to run properly, then try disabling "Lighting
Effects" (from the main menu, go to Options).</p>

<p>If the game fails to run, or has problems, please try the following:<ul>
  <li>For Windows, make sure you have installed the required libraries/DLLs (see
  <a href="index.html#download">Download</a>).</li>
  <li>On Linux, try running from the command line (from Terminal window, type
  erebus) to see if that gives any informative error message.</li>
  <li>On Windows and Linux, ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.</li>
  <li>On Symbian and Android</a>, try quitting additional applications if you are low on memory
  (older phones with less than 256MB RAM may have trouble if too many other applications are
  running).</li>
  <li>On Android, on rare occasions Ministro may fail to download the required
  libraries due to network or server problems - please try again later to see if
  the problem still persists.</li>
  <li>On any platform, a resolution of 640x360 or higher is required. Android phones with low
  resolutions (480x320 or less) may have problems; all other platforms should be fine.</li>
  <li>Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to report any problems.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="knownissues"><h2>Known issues</h2></p>

<p>There are some known issues:<ul>
<li>On Android, when switching back from another app, the display sometimes takes a while to resume. Switching to the homescreen then back to the game may help.</li>
<li>On Windows XP, the game may crash on exit - <a href="https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/issues/30">this seems to be due to a bug with SFML</a>. Windows Vista onwards should be fine.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="mainmenu"><h2>Main menu</h2></p>

<p>The main menu has options to start the game or load a previously saved game,
or set some options. The available options are:<ul>
<li><b>Master Volume</b> - For music and sound effects. Note this option is not available on Android - on Android devices, you can change
the volume at any time using the volume controls on your device.</li>
<li><b>Music Volume, Effects Volume</b> - You can also control the relative volume of music and sound effects (this option
is available on Android).
<li><b>Lighting</b> - If enabled, a lighting effect surrounds your player. If you
get poor performance, try disabling this option.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You can also select "Offline help" to open up these instructions, or "Online
help" to launch this website in your browser ("Online help" is better as it
allows you to play the game while the instructions are open in the browser, as
well as meaning you get the latest version of the webpage, but "Offline help" is
useful if you are without an Internet connection).</p>

<p>On Android, the Load menu also provides the option to Import and Export save game
files. The Export option can be used to access the save game files, e.g., to send
them to me for debugging purposes - see
<a href="#contact">Contacting me</a> for details. It also allows you to backup save
games, or transfer them to another Android device. To Import, copy the save game files
into the folder net.sourceforge.erebusrpg/ (in sdcard/) (created automatically when
you run Erebus for the first time), then use the Import option to be able to use them.
Note that the Import and Export options will overwrite any existing files with the same
name.</p>

<p>When starting the game, you also have various choices:<ul>
<li><b>Game type</b> - The following game types are available:<ul>
    <li><i>Begin Campaign</i> - Play through the series of quests that
    I have written for Erebus.</li>
    <li><i>Random Dungeon</i> - Play a single one-off dungeon that is
    randomly generated. There is no objective to random dungeons, but
    you can see how much experience (XP) you can achieve, or perhaps how
    much gold you can find! (Note that generating the random dungeon may
    take a while on slower phones/tablets.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Character</b> - Choice of Barbarian, Elf, Halfling, Ranger or Warrior.
This is who you will play as, and affects your starting statistics, and the
items you start with. Each character also has their own special skills.
Some characters may be easier to play with than others!</li>
<li><b>Difficulty</b> - Affects things like how easy or hard it will be to
defeat enemies in combat, avoid traps, and so on.</li>
<li><b>Permadeath</b> - If enabled, then this enables
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_death">"Permanent death"</a>
game mode - you'll only ever be allowed one save game file for this game, and
the save game will be deleted automatically if you die. So you can still save
for the purpose of continuing gameplay later, but if your character dies, it's
permanent - so think carefully before choosing this option!</ul></p>

<p><a name="quickstart"><h2>Quickstart</h2></p>

<p>Click "Start game", then click "Next" (accepting the default options) until the game starts.
After the game loads, you'll be shown details
of your first quest: to kill all the goblins in the dungeon.</p>

<p>To move your character, click where you want to move to (either with the mouse,
or touch for touchscreens). You can scroll the view around by clicking/touching
and dragging (also on PCs, you can scroll by moving the mouse to the edge of the
screen).</p>

<p>Move your character to the right, to the crossroads, and you will soon be
attacked by a goblin! To fight, click/touch on the goblin.</p>

<p>Towards the top left will be displayed your portrait, and a green bar indicating
your health. When you are attacking an enemy, next to this will be displayed the
name of the enemy, and a red bar indicating its health.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will be able to defeat the goblin, which will then leave
behind some gold to pick up. Enemies may be carrying gold and/or items, which
they leave behind when they die. To pick up gold or an item, simply click/touch
to move over the item, then click/touch on the item to pick it up.</p>

<p>Now explore the rest of the dungeon, and kill all remaining goblins! If your
health becomes low, you should rest. You can rest by clicking on the Rest button
on the left of the screen, when not near enemies, and this will restore your
health. If you encounter doors, click/touch on them to open the door. You will
be told when you have completed the quest. When this is so, return to where you
started, and exit through the door that was to the left. You can do this by
click/touching to move to the door, then click/touch to exit.</p>

<p>This should be enough information to get you started, but it is recommended
to read the rest of the instructions here!</p>

<p><a name="controls"><h2>Controls</h2></p>

<p>As explained in "Quickstart", you can move your character around by
click/touching where you want to move to. You can also click/touch and drag to
move the view around. On PCs you can also scroll by moving the mouse to the edge
of the screen.

<p>You can zoom in and out by using the "zoom" gesture on multitouch touchpads or
multitouch touchscreens (or see the zoom in and out GUI buttons, below).</p>

<p>There are various other controls:<ul>
<li><b>Attack an enemy</b> - Click on the enemy. If you have a ranged weapon,
you will be able to shoot enemies from a distance.</li>
<li><b>Talking to an NPC</b> - For friendly NPCs, you can click on them to talk
to them. Some NPCs will be traders or shopkeepers, and talking to them will
allow you to buy and sell items.</li>
<li><b>Opening a door</b> - Walk up near to the door, then click on the door.
Some doors will "open" simply by disappearing and letting you walk through the
door. Other doors are "exits", and clicking on them will take you to a different
location. Some doors may be locked, and can only be opened if you have the correct
key. To leave the dungeon, click on the exit that was near where you started.
You can leave the dungeon at any time, including before completing the quest -
if the quest isn't yet completed, you will be allowed to rest, healing your
wounds, as well as being able to spend money in shops, before returning to the
dungeon to complete your quest.</li>
<li><b>Interacting with scenery / opening containers</b> - You can try
interacting with any scenery by walking up to it and clicking on it. For example,
clicking on a treasure chest will reveal any times inside it. Other kinds of
scenery may show you a set of options when you click on them.</li>
<li><b>Picking up items</b> - Click on the items when you are standing near to
them. Note that at the moment you don't get a choice if there is more than one
- so click repeatedly to pick them all up, then drop any that you don't want
(see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Erebus can also be controlled via a keyboard:<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> with the arrow keys, or W/A/S/D (use combinations to move
diagonally), or the numeric keypad.</li>
<li><b>Action</b> - Press space or return/enter for a generic action, which will be:
attack or talk to an NPC in front of you (or otherwise attack the nearest enemy
in the direction you are facing if you are armed with a ranged weapon); open a door
in front of you; interact with scenery (or open a container) in front of you, or
picking up items at your feet.</li>
<li><b>Force pick up</b> - You can also pick up items at your feet by pressing
"U" (normally pressing space/enter will work, but not if there's also something
in front to interact with).</li>
<li><b>Target/Next enemy</b> - Press 'N' to "target" an NPC, or cycle through
the visible enemies (targetting controls which enemy you are attacking -
particularly useful when using a ranged weapon, with keyboard control).
</ul></p>

<p>There is a row of GUI button icons towards the top-right, providing the following
controls (in order, left-to-right):<ul>
<li><b>Turbo (shortcut 'T')</b> - This is a toggle button. When enabled, the game time
progresses twice as fast. This can be useful when travelling along long passageways
that you've already explored.</li>
<li><b>Quicksave (shortut 'F5')</b> - Quick-saves the current game under the name
"quicksave.xml". This option is not available in "Permadeath" mode.</li>
<li><b>Target/Next enemy</b> - Targets an enemy (so you will attack, moving towards the
enemy if necessary), or cycles through the enemies if one is already targetted. Can be
useful on touchscreens if you are having difficulty picking which enemy to attack.
<li><b>Zoom out (shortcut '<')</b> - Zooms the display out.</li>
<li><b>Zoom in (shortcut '>')</b> - Zooms the display in.</li>
<li><b>Centre (shortcut 'C')</b> - Centres the display on the player.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There are further controls and information that can be accessed from the
buttons on the left hand side (or via a keyboard shortcut):</p>

<p><a name="stats"><h3>Stats (F1)</h3></p>

<p>This shows your character's current statistics, which indicate how good you
are at various activities, as well as your current health, and experience:<ul>
<li><b>Fighting Prowess (FP)</b> - How skilled your character is in hand-to-hand
combat. Some weapons may increase or decrease your FP. If you are unarmed, your
FP is reduced by 2.</li>
<li><b>Bow Skill (BS)</b> - How skilled your character is at firing bows.</li>
<li><b>Strength (S)</b> - How strong your character is. Stronger characters are
able to inflict stronger blows on their enemies. They can also carry more
items. Some weapons and armour may have a minimum strength required for their use.</li>
<li><b>Attacks (A)</b> - A greater value means a faster rate of attack.</li>
<li><b>Mind (M)</b> - Used for magic attacks and defence. Some spells only
cause harm to the target if the spellcaster wins a Mind roll against the target.
The chance of success depends on how the two characters' Mind statistic
compares. It is also used instead of Fighting Prowess when fighting enemies in
hand-to-hand combat that can only be harmed by magic weapons.</li>
<li><b>Dexterity (D)</b> - How good your character is at avoiding traps, and
avoiding being hit by arrows.</li>
<li><b>Bravery (B)</b> - Some enemies (such as the undead) cause <i>terror</i>.
This may cause you to be temporarily paralysed from fear when you encounter
them. A higher bravery score reduces the chance of this happening. (For
enemies, having a lower Bravery means they are more likely to flee when
sufficiently injured.)</li>
<li><b>Speed (Sp)</b> - How fast your character moves.</li>
<li><b>Health (H)</b> - Your current health and "maximum" health. Your health can
never exceed the maximum value (though the maximum value will increase as your
character becomes more experienced). If your health reaches 0, you are dead.</li>
<li><b>Level</b> - Your character's experience level. This will increase every so
often when you receive enough XP (see below). Every time it increases, some of
your character's stats will increase. You will be given a choice of 2 statistics
to increase. Your Speed and Health will also increase with every level.</li>
<li><b>XP</b> - Your current XP, and how many are needed to progress to the next
Level. You receive XP by various actions, such as killing enemies, unlocking
doors, completing sub-quests.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="items"><h3>Items (F2)</h3></p>

<p>This window displays the items that you are carrying. You can filter the list
by selecting the options along the top (e.g., to only display weapons, click
"Wpns"). The window also displays how much gold you have, and the current
weight in the format "current weight / maximum weight". If the current weight
exceeds the maximum weight you can carry, you must drop some items before you
can move.</p>

<p>To do more with a particular item, select the item by clicking it. You can
then:<ul>
<li>Drop the item, by clicking "Drop Item" at the bottom.</li>
<li>Read more information on the item, by clicking "Info" at the bottom.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There are also special types of items: weapons, armour and shields.</p>

<p>Weapons are used in combat. Your current weapon, if any, is indicated with
"[Current Weapon]". To use a different weapon, select it then click "Arm
Weapon". You can also disarm the current weapon by selecting it and clicking
"Disarm Weapon". If you have no weapon armed you will fight with your fists,
though this is not recommended. Different weapons have different amounts of
damage, which you can see by selecting the "Info" option. Damage is given in a
format of rolling dice, as: "X"D"Y" + "Z", where "X" is the number of dice
thrown, "Y" is the type of dice ("Y" equal to 10 means a D10, i.e., a 10 sided
die with numbers 1 to 10), "Z" is the number added to the value. So "2D10 + 1"
means roll two D10s, add the results, and add 1. "3D6 - 1" means roll three
D6s, add the results, and subtract 1.</p>

<p>Some weapons are "ranged" (e.g., bows) which means you can use them from a
distance. They also need ammunition (e.g., arrows are needed for bows) which are
stored as a separate item.</p>

<p>Some weapons have a minimum strength (see "Info") - if your strength is not
high enough, you will be unable to fight with this weapon!</p>

<p>Armour is worn to protect you in combat, reducing the damage you take. Similar
to with weapons, the currently worn armour is indicated with "[Current Armour]",
and you can change into new armour by selecting it, and clicking "Wear Armour"
(or "Take Off Armour" to take it off).</p>

<p>Some armour types have a minimum strength (see "Info") - if your strength is
not high enough, you will be unable to move with this armour!</p>

<p>Shields may also be used, but not if you are using a two-handed weapon. To
use a shield, select the shield and click "Arm Shield" (or "Disarm Shield" to
stop using it). A shield will provide you with extra protection in combat.</p>

<p>Some other kinds of items may allow additional options - e.g., potions
allowing you the option to drink them.</p>

<!--<p><a name="spells"><h3>Spells</h3></p>

<p>Not yet available, so this button does nothing!</p>-->

<p><a name="journal"><h3>Journal (F3)</h3></p>

<p>Displays details of your quest.</p>

<p><a name="pause"><h3>Pause (P)</h3></p>

<p>Pauses the game. To unpause, click anywhere. Note that the game also pauses
when the window is deactivated, so again click anywhere to unpause.</p>

<p><a name="rest"><h3>Rest (R)</h3></p>

<p>Rest until you have recovered your health. You can't rest if enemies are
nearby. In some locations, there may be a risk of being woken by a wandering
monster!</p>

<p><a name="options"><h3>Options (Escape)</h3></p>

<p>This offers the following options:<ul>
<li><b>Quit game</b> - Quits the current game. Make sure you save the game
first if you don't want to lose it!</li>
<li><b>Save game</b> - Saves the current game under a filename of your choosing
(or overwrite an existing one). A default filename is provided consisting of the
current date and time. As with resting, you cannot save the game if enemies are
nearby. Note that the game will be automatically saved when you move from one
location to another, under "autosave.xml" (except on Symbian).</li>
<li><b>Back to game</b> - Don't do anything, and return to the game.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="leavingthedungeon"><h2>Leaving the dungeon</h2></p>

<p>As explained above, you can leave the dungeon at any time by clicking on the
exit near where you started. This will heal your wounds (as with resting). You
can also visit various shops to buy items with your gold, and sell any items you
found that you don't want. Note that the sale price of items will always be less
than the purchase price!</p>

<p>If you haven't completed your quest yet, you can click "Continue your Quest"
to return to the dungeon to complete your quest. If you had completed the quest,
then you can click "Start next Quest" to start the next quest.</p>

<p>If you are on the last quest, and have completed it, then leaving the dungeon
means you have completed the game! Note that currently Erebus is a work in
progress, and more quests will be added in future versions. If you have a save
game file, this should be compatible with future versions (note that changes to
the quest you are currently playing will not take effect on any existing save
game files, to avoid risk of incompatibilities, but you should be able to move
onto any new quests that have been added).</p>

<p><a name="enemies"><h2>Enemies</h2></p>

<p>There are many dangerous enemies you may meet during your adventures:</p>

<p><b>Goblins.</b> These are small, foul creatures. Whilst one of the weaker
races of evil, they are still able to overpower less experienced adventurers,
and can be deadly in numbers. Whilst many goblins form their own tribes,
others are found enslaved by larger creatures such as Orcs.</p>

<p><b>Hobgoblins.</b> These are believed to be a cross between Goblins and
Orcs, and are less common than either of those creatures. They look similar
to Goblins, but are stronger opponents.</p>

<p><b>Orcs.</b> These are the most common enemy to civilised societies. Large
and brutish, they are physically stronger than many humans. They mostly dwell
underground in caves and dungeons, but can be found in the wilderness. They
typically live and travel in packs. They usually keep away from human
settlements, instead only attacking travellers and adventurers, but they are
most dangerous when well trained and organised into armies.</p>

<p><b>Trolls.</b> These are huge, stupid creatures, but have great strength and
make strong opponents. They have the special ability to regenerate their health,
even when engaged in combat, which can make them particularly hard to kill.</p>

<p><b>Wyverns.</b> Winged reptiles. These fast flying animals are often hostile.</p>

<p><b>Zombies.</b> These unnatural beings are rotting corpses of the recently
deceased, animated back to life by magical means. These undead creatures move
slowly, but are strong opponents. They are also ridden with disease, which can
be caught by those they strike. If you are infected with disease, this will
reduce your Fighting Prowess and Strength by 1. This can only be cured with a
Cure Disease potion.</p>

<p><b>Skeletons.</b> These terrifying undead creatures are created by
necromancers, often to acts as their servants, as guardians, or even form
massive armies. Arrows are not very effective against skeletons.</p>

<p><b>Shadows.</b> These undead beings are ghostly creatures, trapped on this
earthly plane. These evil creatures were once people. Now, they can only be
seen by their shadows, and they can be harmed only by magical weapons.</p>

<p><b>Fire Ants.</b> Huge ants, usually that live underground. They are fast
moving. Beware when you kill them, as they explode upon dying!</p>

<p><b>Giant Spiders.</b> Some species of spider can grow to a size larger than
a human. They may be found underground, or in some parts of the wilderness.
They also have the ability to cause temporary paralysis on a successful hit,
due to their poisonous bite!</p>

<p><b>Minotaurs.</b> The head of bull with the body of a human, these creatures
are presumably created through magical means or perhaps other experimentation.</p>

<p><a name="magic"><h2>Magic</h2></p>

<p>Currently your player cannot use magic (though this will be added in later
versions), but you will encounter some enemies that can cast spells. The
existing magic system is fairly simple, though the following spells are
currently implemented:</p>

<p><b>Acid Strike.</b> The spell causes a jet of acid to be sprayed at the
target, causing 2D20 damage (reduced by armour or shield).</p>

<p><b>Agony.</b> The spell uses the caster's psychic energy, directed at the
unfortunate recipient, causing great pain - and 2D20 damage (with no defence
from armour or shield). The effects can be avoided with a successful Mind test.
</p>

<p><b>Fire Bolt.</b> The spellcaster shoots forth a bolt of fire at the target,
causing 2D10 damage (a shield reduces damage, armour has no effect).</p>

<p><b>Heal.</b> This spell heals the recipient, causing wounds to magically
close up, bruises to disappear, fractured bones to be mended and so on,
restoring 4D6 health points.</p>

<p><b>Paralyse.</b> If the recipient fails a Mind test, then he or she is
gripped with feelings of terror and dread, and unable to move, for 10 seconds.</p>

<p><a name="commandline"><h2>Command line options</h2></p>

<p>On non-mobile platforms, Erebus can be run in windowed mode by running from the command line
with the argument "-windowed". E.g., on Windows, run with:

<pre>erebus.exe -windowed</pre></p>

<p>You can also set the folder for where data will be loaded from, e.g., on Linux:

<pre>./erebus -datafolder=/home/my_user/Documents/erebussrc/</pre></p>

<p><a name="contact"><h2>Contacting me (bugs etc)</h2></p>

<p>Please contact me at <b>mark dot harman at ntlworld dot com</b> .</p>

<p>If you are reporting a bug, if possible please send me:<ul>
  <li>Any reported error messages.</li>
	<li>The "log.txt" file. This can be found:<ul>
    <li>For Windows, in %LOCALAPPDATA%\erebus (or on Windows XP, "%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\erebus").</li>
    <li>
      For Linux, it should be in $HOME/.local/share/data/erebus (in Ubuntu, make sure View->Show Hidden
      Files is selected). If not, try looking for an erebus/ folder somewhere in your home folder.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Android, it's located in the folder net.sourceforge.erebusrpg/ (in sdcard/). You can view with a file
      explorer app (such as
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a>),
      or access by connecting your phone/tablet to a PC. If you can't see the folder, try rebooting your
      phone before connecting to your PC.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Symbian it's located in the folder private/2006dbd2 on the drive that you installed the
      game on.<!--The folder needs changing, if we change the UID of the game!--> Seeing this folder
      is a bit tricky, as it's hidden when viewing on the phone. You can access by connecting your
      phone to a PC and selecting "mass storage" to view the drives (though this may only be possible
      if you've installed to an external SD card).
    </li>
  </ul>
  The log file is overwritten each time you run the game, so you'll have to take a copy straight
  away - although note that the last-but-one game log will be available under "log_old.txt"; in
  the case of assertion failures, it will also be copied to "log_assertion_failure.txt".</li>
  <li>If under Linux and no log.txt file is generated, try running erebus from a Terminal
  window, and note if that gives any error messages.</li>
  <li>A description of what happened, and what steps you took that resulted in the bug.</li>
  <li>Does the bug happen every time?</li>
  <li>A save game file, if relevant. This is located in the savegames/ folder, in the same location as the log.txt file.
  Note that on Android, you need to export the save game files by clicking "Export"
  from the Load menu. This will copy the save game files to the folder net.sourceforge.erebusrpg/ (in sdcard/),
  which you can access the same way as the log.txt file (see above). Also note that if a save game file fails
  to load, that file will automatically be copied to the folder. (The reason for doing it this way is that
  it's not possible to view an Android application's folders on internal storage, unless you have root.)</li>
  <li>Any details of your system may also be helpful, e.g.: operating system and version, CPU, graphics
  card, Direct X version if relevant, make/model of smartphone/tablet if relevant.</li>

<p><a name="helpwanted"><h2>Help wanted!</h2></p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to Erebus, there are various ways you can help:<ul>
<li><b>Graphics artists</b> - More graphics would be useful to have. Examples include NPCs (animated enemies, static NPCs, and portraits), scenery, items, images to illustrate game messages, and documentation artwork. Please contact me if you want info on the expected graphics/animation formats, or what sort of images would be useful.</li>
<li><b>Musicians</b> - I have someone working on background music for the game, but more sound effects are also welcome!</li>
<li><b>Porting</b> - Feel free to port Erebus to other platforms - it should be easy to port to any OS that supports Qt. If code changes are required, if you send me the files I can integrate them into the main source (please check the Git repository on Sourceforge for the latest version to work with).</li>
<li><b>Tell people about it!</b> - If you like the game, then please feel free to tell other people about it, on your blog/Twitter/website/etc :)
Feel free to link with the following HTML code (or just do a plain text link if you prefer):
<pre>&lt;a href="http://erebusrpg.sourceforge.net/"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://erebusrpg.sourceforge.net/erebus_logo1.png" title="erebus"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li><b>Give me a nice rating :)</b> (On Nokia/Android stores, or other hosting sites...)</li>
<li><b>Videos</b> - videos of the gameplay (e.g., on YouTube) would be useful to have, partly to help raise awareness, and also to act as gameplay tutorials.</li>

FIXED   View shouldn't follow the player's position if close to edge of screen,

ADDED   New enemy Fire Ant, added to 3rd quest.

        an attack when running away, when using keyboard control).
UPDATED Don't display item weights in player sell list when trading.

Version 0.13 (2014/02/10)

FIXED   Problem if pressing Alt+F4 (Windows) or back button (Android) during
        the Start game options pages - starting the game again wouldn't reset
        to the first options page, and in some cases this would cause a crash.
FIXED   Problems on Android if pressing back button whilst starting/loading a
        game (either game would quit completely without warning, or multiple
        confirmation windows could open).
FIXED   Level up window on Android had text overlapping with checkboxes.
FIXED   Bug with keyboard detection when another window opened when a key was
        being pressed.
FIXED   With keyboard movement, only cancel player action if changing direction.
FIXED   Incorrect text for one of the ghost's lines in 2nd quest.
FIXED   When using keyboard control, when armed with ranged weapon, and enemy
        targetted, a "swish" sound would play even when the player was being
        moved with the keyboard.
FIXED   Improved picking up of items - in particular, problem on 1st quest
        where the Red Gem would sometimes be missed, when picking up the
        Goblin's items.
ADDED   Skill system. Each character now has a set of special skills, giving
        them particular abilities.
ADDED   Implemented multiple Attacks; new Potion of Rage (+1 Attacks); Minotaur
        now has 2 attacks.

ADDED   New weapon: sling.
ADDED   New enemy Troll, added to 3rd quest.
ADDED   New GUI button to target an enemy (so you will attack, moving towards
        the enemy if necessary), or cycles through the enemies if one is
        already targetted. Can be useful on touchscreens if you are having
        difficulty picking which enemy to attack.
UPDATED Character choice screen now displays picture, stats, skills and details
        for the currently selected choice.
UPDATED Improved layout of stats window.
UPDATED Info window for items (e.g., when buying items) now displays if a
        weapon or armour is too weak for your character.

UPDATED Improved graphics for spell casting.
UPDATED When fighting enemies that require a magical weapon, hand-to-hand

UPDATED Reintroduce specific graphics for Goblin Champion.
UPDATED New graphics for Orc Champion, Hobgoblin and Shadow.
UPDATED Added some more Hobgoblins to 3rd quest.

        used for Troll, and Minotaur has also been enlarged).
UPDATED Android devices with low resolutions (specifically, "normal" screen
        size that are ldpi or mdpi) are now blocked in Google Play. In
        practice, this rules out devices with resolution 480x320 or less, which
        Erebus does not support. Please let me know if this has blocked your
        device, and it has a resolution of 800x480 or higher!
UPDATED Pressing 'N' to target/switch an enemy now moves the player towards the
        enemy to attack, if necessary.

Version 0.12 (2013/12/08)

FIXED   Problem failing to load saved games in some circumstances - note that

        shouldn't occur with new save games that are now created.

        initialised correctly.

FIXED   Fixed level up window for lower resolution non-mobile screens (e.g.,
        1024x600 netbooks).
FIXED   Made it so that "Inn" shop doesn't appear in campaign window, nor as an
        NPC shopkeeper in random dungeons.
FIXED   On Android, text windows were slightly misaligned if scrolling (due to
        attempting to display a scrollbar).
ADDED   New music by Alexander Timoshenko (on Windows and Linux).
ADDED   Option to import/export save game files from/to external storage on
        Android.
ADDED   If save game fails to load on Android, save game file will be copied to
        SD card.
ADDED   New command line option -datafolder to specify location of data folder.
UPDATED No longer using WebKit - on Android, this reduces the required library
        downloads from ~25MB to ~10MB; on Windows, this reduces the required
        install size by ~10MB.
UPDATED Now using SFML 2 instead of Phonon for audio on Windows and Linux
        (allows gapless looping, and fixes audio problems on Linux). Note that
        unfortunately an SFML bug means the game will now crash on Windows XP -
        see known issues.
UPDATED Added footsteps sounds for Linux (now work properly with SFML).

        without closing the options window.
FIXED   Options window wasn't closed when saving in permadeath mode.
FIXED   Fatal signal on exit on Android.
FIXED   Improved french translation for low resolution screens (e.g., 800x480).
FIXED   Player animation would sometimes appear jerky when using keyboard
        movement.
UPDATED Android version now pauses when app goes inactive; also should preserve
        battery life better due to disabling updates and game logic when
        inactive.
UPDATED Volume on Android version now controlled entirely through device's
        volume keys.
UPDATED Android screen now remains on rather than blanking when idle.
UPDATED Performance improvements.

        can be viewed without having root).

        android:installLocation="auto").
ADDED   Code for handling translations for "hardcoded" (not quest data) text
        (thanks to Jeremy Lomoro).
ADDED   Partial French translation (thanks to Jeremy Lomoro) (Windows and Linux
        only for now).
ADDED   Locations can now take game time to travel between them (not yet made
        use of in any existing quests).

Version 0.8 (2013/05/23) (Only released for Source and Android)

        when some windows were displayed.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Two comments I made on the pullreq page, which are probably better discussed here:
&gt; &gt; * The 0xFFFFFFFF/(n-1)*i seed value seems intended to result in large bit
&gt; &gt;   differences between the different hash function&#39;s seeds. Together with the tweak,
&gt; &gt;   however, the first and the last now get seeds tweak and tweak-1. I think
&gt; &gt;   something simpler like k1*i+k2*n+tweak is better (with k1 and k2 arbitrary large
&gt; &gt;   odd 32-bit integers).
&gt; Meh, sure, whatever...I dont really think the seed values matter
&gt; significantly (Murmur3 isnt that bad of a hash function...) (and the
&gt; original algorithm wont result in a significant bit difference between
&gt; the seeds in many cases).

Sure, it&#39;s nothing important, but it seems like it fails to do what it was intended for.

How about just this: tweak + i*0xFBA4C795 (number optimized to give large seed
differences for every tweak). If you want variation when changing the number of hash
functions, just choose a different seed. 

&gt; &gt; Maybe the actual filter data in filterload can be made optional:
&gt; &gt;   if it is omitted, it&#39;s assumed to be all zeroes (though that would mean the size
&gt; &gt;   has to be specified).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m not sure here, if you are sending a filter just to use filteradd to
&gt; add things to it manually, you are doing something very, very, very
&gt; wrong... Though we could certainly do some kind of compressed bloom
&gt; filter encoding to allow for small filter loads (loading the few things
&gt; you need to filteradd right away) where you anticipate adding
&gt; significantly more filter elements down the road (can anyone even come
&gt; up with a case where you anticipate doing this?), the filter is small
&gt; enough (max 36kB) that I see little benefit for the large increase in
&gt; complexity (or is this another repeat of the merkle branch discussion?)

It&#39;s probably not worth it for something that is max 36 kilobytes. If ever
necessary, we can define a new message type that just lists a number of bits to
be set in the server-side filter.

For now, I agree that you should just send the filter as intended, and not expect to
do many filteradds (though you should take the implicitly-added txids into
accounted when computing the filter size).

[Bitcoin-development] [ANNOUNCE] picocoin and libccoin -- C-based
bitcoin library and client
From: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@ex...> - 2012-11-27 20:34:18
Source code URL:  https://github.com/jgarzik/picocoin/

I&#39;d like to announce another bitcoin implementation, which is really
two useful pieces in one:

     libccoin - a bitcoin library, written in C
     picocoin - A lightweight, C-based SPV bitcoin wallet client

libccoin supports all key network datastructures (block, transaction,
etc.), script parsing and validation, transaction and block
validation, a &#34;headers-only&#34; or full block database, and many other
features essential to any bitcoin client.  libccoin passes all key
encoding, script and transaction tests available in the Satoshi
reference bitcoin client.

picocoin is much more under construction.  When complete, it will be a
very low resource, command line / JSON-driven bitcoin wallet.
Advanced security features already implemented include required wallet
encryption, fork-based process separation of P2P networking and wallet
(and chroot/SELinux jailing coming soon), something that the reference
Satoshi client does not even support.

Status:  Alpha quality, developer release.  Passes reference client
base58/script/transaction tests, but is still a developer-only
preview.

Feature list:

    Intended to be a full-feature bitcoin support library.  The
library will not be limited to &#34;what picocoin needs.&#34;
    Supports all core data structures and network messages
    Full script implementation
    Passes hundreds of available reference client tests
    Supports multiple block chains: main or testnet3
    Very low resource usage (cpu, disk, and memory)
    Small codebase (both source code and compiled object)
    Supports advanced thin-client features such as &#34;bloom filtering&#34;,
an upcoming proposal that will reduce client bandwidth usage.
    Works on big endian machines, as well as little endian machines
    Multi-platform: Linux supported currently.  Should work on
OSX/BSD/Windows with minimal modifications.
    libccoin should work on Windows.  picocoin will work on Windows,
but be a bit less secure than other platforms due to lack of fork.
    Improved security:  fork-based process separation firewall between
networking and wallet code -- your wallet is never directly exposed to
the network.
    Follows the philosophy of &#34;do, not hype.&#34;  This library is already
far more secure and capable than other libraries hyped as the &#34;future
of bitcoin&#34; by their authors.

Code contributions are welcome (see github URL above).
Comments are welcome.

OK, I see. I guess that could be a reasonable fallback for the case
where you have a secure channel.

Yes, exactly. It&#39;s about paying who you think you&#39;re paying (when you
confirm on a second uncompromised device).

In particular two additional identification types:

The hash-based system would be there as a method of leveraging an existing 
trusted connection, without needing to get into the nitty-gritty of 
certificates.  For example, I am paying for something on a web site; I 
presumably already have a secure connection that I trust to that site.  That 
site can issue me an invoice (which is to be sent to the bitcoin client) _and_ 
a hash of the certificate on the same page.

I trust that hash because I received it over a secure connection from a 
trusted source.  When my bitcoin client pops up with the received invoice, it 
shows me the hash of the invoice, and I can be sure that it is from the web 
site I thought it was from.

Imagine I&#39;m a (very) small business, I have two or three customers.  I want to 
email one of my customers an invoice.  I don&#39;t want to have to get an X509 
certificate, and I don&#39;t necessarily know how.  However, I can ring my 
customer up and say &#34;I&#39;ve generated an invoice with my bitcoin client, it is 
hashed A7DE-521X-9977.  Write that down and confirm it when you get my 
invoice&#34;.  Alternatively, I might attach a file called
invoice-A7DE-521X-9977.bitinv to a signed GnuPG email.  The receipient can 
easily confirm I sent it because the filename must match the contents and 
GnuPG protects against tampering.

One more thought:

RE: &#34;Receipt&#34; verus &#34;Acceptance&#34; :

I believe &#34;Receipt&#34; is the right term-- it means &#34;I got your payment&#34;,
NOT &#34;your payment has cleared.&#34;  E.g. if I hand a merchant a paper
check they&#39;ll hand me a receipt, but the check could still bounce.
That&#39;s the analogy here-- a merchant might give you a receipt, but if
the transaction is rejected by the network for whatever reason (Finney
attack maybe) you cannot expect to go to court with your
invoice/receipt and claim you made a valid payment.

RE: &#34;it is controversial use of the host key to use it for digital
signing of documents&#34;  :  The idea of embedding a x509 certificate
chain comes from the IETF&#39;s JSON Object Signing and Encryption working
group &#34;JWS&#34; specification, so I can&#39;t be TOO controversial.

RE: the ifex-project and other electronic invoicing standards:  Thanks
for the pointers, Walter! I&#39;m all for adopting the best ideas that
have come before, as long as we end up with something useful and small
enough to convince ourselves it is as secure as we can make it. I
looked at the ifex spec, and quickly got lost. It would help me if you
could write up what our motivating use cases would look like if
implemented on top of ifex.

RE: jgarzik&#39;s suggestion to allow txids in the Payment: that worries
me, because it is trivial to create several different variations of
the same transaction (same inputs to same outputs) with different
txids (re-signing inputs uses a different signature nonce, which
changes the signature/txid, for example).

RE: using self-signed certificates:  as Mike said, I assume Bitcoin
clients will have some way of managing root certificates, so experts
could add trusted self-signed certs.

&gt; No, the point of using X509 certs is to get a verified identity (a
&gt; domain name) on the receipt, this is needed for multi-factor
&gt; authentication. You can&#39;t do that without some kind of third party
&gt; asserting to an identity.


Agree that you need a third party to verify identity. But the verification policy of sites is the job for a payment provider not a payment technology. So if you would like verification of the site you could just sign the memo using standard S/MIME - why mix it with the payment protocol?

Further, it is controversial use of the host key to use it for digital signing of documents, and not even within the policy of a host certificate as far as I recall.

The problem you are trying to tackle is that we don&#39;t have an ID solution on the internet today for this purpose. Certificates for signing messages are distributed freely and insecurely only based on temporarily having an email from within an organization, and the host certificates are meant for SSL handshakes. Funnily, any CA can issue digital certificates for email signing for any domain, even though they don&#39;t own them, and without notifying the owner. DANE actually solves this, but until then using the host certificates is unintended use, it is cryptographically a nice solution, but legally and standard-wise a hack.

I guess that moves the discussion from developers to lawyers ;) Even though you send a signed receipt, if you can proof you didn&#39;t get the money, you will never be expected to deliver the goods. (and you can even write that in the the receipt ...)

So the SignedReceipt is legally not worth the bits it is composed of, hence I don&#39;t see the point in supporting it.

If you are selling atoms you can usually wait for N confirmations (even though you start shipping I guess you can recall a parcel within 144 blocks). If you are selling bits (like access to a site), you can revoke that access once you discover the transaction did not go through. So I can&#39;t find a use case where a Signed Receipt in the proposed form is advantageous.

Gavin&#39;s proposal differs in this from my original proposal, where I
exactly *didn&#39;t* want to couple the receipt with the acceptance of
the Bitcoin transaction.

If a merchant/payment processor is willing to take the risk of zero or
low confirmation transactions (because they are insured against it,
for example), they were allowed to reply &#34;accepted&#34; immediately, and
this would be a permanent proof of payment, even if the actual Bitcoin
transaction that backs it gets reverted.

For that reason, I also had a separate &#34;pending&#34; state, which means the
receiver isn&#39;t willing to just accept the current state as irrevocably
paid. In this case, the sender was allowed to retry until the receipt
sayd &#34;accepted&#34; or &#34;rejected&#34;.

The whole point was to avoid that customers/merchants would have to
deal with the uncertainty involved in Bitcoin transaction. At some
point, someone is going to accept the transaction (whether that is at
0 or at 120 confirmations), and acceptance will at the higher level
be considered a boolean anyway - not some &#34;probably, unless reorg&#34;.

I think this is a problem with confusing terminology rather then the
spec itself.

The original formulation had a receipt being something generated
purely by the buyer. The signed Invoice message  + the Bitcoin
transactions paying to the outputs + the merkle branches showing
acceptance by the network *is* the receipt.

The SignedReceipt message is useful in the sense that it shows

Short comments:

* What if the SignedReceipt is not received AND the transactions IS posted on the p2p. Then you have payed for the goods, but you don&#39;t have a receipt. This could happen both from malice or system failures.
** Suggestion - sign the invoice with the key to which to send the transaction, the proof of payment, equivalent to a signed receipt is then in the blockchain.

This scheme would work both with or without x509, if you want to include x509, the message in the invoice could simply be signed by the x509 certificate as well.

PRO: Any user can send signed invoices, not only those with a x509 cert.
PRO: No limbo situation with no SignedReceipt
CON: This disables the use of anything but payment to key/address incl multisig etc.

However, the wast majority of use will anyway be payment to key/address.

Support of general pay to script could be supported through the payment scheme proposed earlier by Mike: No non-fee payments are accepted, except in a group - i.e. it is up to the merchant to generate the final transaction incl the fees, and that one could be to a general script. This also keeps the support of pay to general script needed for a client to a minimum.

Cheers,

Michael

Luke-Jr - common subset of what operating systems ship is fine for me
as long as people do due diligence around mobile OS&#39; here. It seems
easier to me to just grab a list from a popular browser, on the
grounds that SSL is mostly used by them so nobody is going to buy an
SSL cert rejected by IE/Firefox/Chrome/etc. But intersecting OS lists
is effectively the same.

For my own clients I&#39;d just ship my own copy of the canonical CA certs
regardless, because integrating with each operating systems
proprietary crypto APIs is a lot of work vs just loading a pem file
into OpenSSL. If there are a lot of people who want to use the OS cert
management UIs then I guess that can be a point wallet clients compete
on.

&gt; Removing that and adding a opaque string called domain name, or
&gt; identityName would be sufficient to move the conversation forward
&gt; without the x.509 baggage.

But it would result in implementations that do not meet the requirements.

Yes, X.509 has problems. It&#39;s in the proposal because we can get the
effect we want (verifiable domain names in the UI) in about 50 lines
of code, today, with the id-verified keys people actually have already
bought.

As Gavin says, we can add optional fields later to extend the protocol
in a backwards compatible way.

&gt;&gt; We are not establishing an IETF working group, which is an option that
&gt;&gt; was explored prior to the Paris meeting and has been sidelined at
&gt;&gt; present for depth-of-bureaucracy by the backing commercial entities.
&gt;&gt; Rather, we are establishing a top-level IANA registry group. This is
&gt;&gt; not anticipated by the IETF old-guard working with us to be either (a)
&gt;&gt; controversial or (b) possible to block.
&gt;
&gt; My last note in this sub-thread.

Mine too!

&gt; There are no IANA registry groups, there is no such thing, and no way
&gt; to form one.

Reading between the lines, I believe this phrase, which is not my own
but that of experienced IETF staff, refers to the groups visible at
http://www.iana.org/protocols/ (which you yourself cited). Whether it
is formally used or not is unknown to me.

&gt; The IETF can ask the IANA to form a registry but these
&gt; things take lots of support and take a long time,

Expert opinion estimates six weeks, and by current estimates, we
should have an arrival circa February.

&gt; and these are only
&gt; created through standards track RFC. ICANN runs the IANA and there is
&gt; no such framework that you elude to. Review
&gt; http://www.iana.org/protocols/

I would like to suggest that perhaps exactly this sort of banter is an
excellent illustration for the Bitcoin community of what we have been
up against in this (conceivable simple an public benefit oriented)
endeavour. If you also look at the fact that the ISO4217 registry (to
take currency/commodity codes as just one example) there is apparently
not even a public list of requirements for codepoint issue.  This sort
of thing is *exactly* why the internet community appears to
desperately need an open registry - allowing public internet bodies
(IANA) to function to support innovation and interconnectivity for all
sectors of the internet&#39;s various financial communities so that
anyone, including innovators, can obtain interoperability via simple,
hassle-free paths, without encountering self-important bureaucrats.

We anticipate victory circa February.

Of the three currently published proposals, all are essentially IANA
registry proposals.

We are currently working with IETF staff, with open offers of support
from multiple well funded commercial bodies, to transition these
proposals through to IANA management.

It appears that the Independent Stream Editor path will be used to
transition these through to IANA, at which time the proposals
themselves will be converted to Informational status.

(As far as I understand right now, Within the IETF, Standards Track
has special meaning and entails relatively large degrees of
bureaucracy that are not within the current contributors&#39; resources.
It is also worth pointing out that many popular protocols implemented
on the majority of systems (IIRC, such as IMAP) never reach formal
standardization for this reason. It should be noted that in these
cases, this does not make the protocols any less attractive as
potential components for system implementation.)

&gt; It also doesn&#39;t appear to address ~any of the the targeted items here.
&gt; Is there another draft I should be looking for which has more overlap
&gt; with the discussion here?

As outlined in the previous post:
  - Internet Financial EXchange (IFEX). A proposal under development
that facilitates the negotiation of financial transactions between
internet-based financial endpoints. (The area we would love your
input) http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/ifex

As well as the information linked to above, significant but not
particularly well grounded discussions have occurred regarding the
IFEX-based paradigm for settlement versus some other proposed
paradigms, in particular Ripple (as it appeared some months ago),
which can be read here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/rippleusers/v4bEBZZVEsA[1-25]

Kind regards and with the hopes of combining our efforts as a joint
proposal that can benefit other currencies/commodities and settlement
systems as well as Bitcoin,

Re: [Bitcoin-development] Payment Protocol Proposal:

&gt; This is the next big &#34;lets all agree to do things the same way&#34; thing
&gt; I think we should tackle. I&#39;m particularly looking for feedback from
&gt; other bitcoin client developers, even if it is just a quick &#34;looks
&gt; reasonable, if everybody else is going to do it then I will
&gt; (eventually) too...&#34;

I agree this is a very pertinent subject, and with a bit of looking
around it is clear that there is a requirement here for emerging
financial ecosystems of many types, certainly not just for the Bitcoin
community, which until now seems to have been getting along just about
OK despite the current levels of complexity.

That said, I have a number of serious concerns with the proposal.

1. Undue Broadening of Scope: From an architectural perspective, if
one accepts the unix mantra of &#34;do one thing and do it well&#34; as
reasonable and time-proven doctrine, given that Bitcoin is already
trying to be both a commodity and a distributed consensus-based
settlement system, does it really make sense to attempt to tack-on
business-level functions?

2. X.509: I have read (somewhere or other, recently) that it is
generally considered bad form to mandate specific cryptographic
systems in new protocols where open support is possible. Given the
recent issues with X.509, the security nightmare that already exists
with the volume of (sometimes cracked, sometimes
government-compromised?) issuers, and the complexity of the scheme, it
seems a little strange to singularly mandate X.509, despite its
widespread use at present.  There are also a swathe of potential
issues around DNS interdependence, information leakage within
certificates themselves and/or their DNS-interpretation by clients,
etc. I would consider suggesting open support with initial support for
GPG, as it is apparently preferred as a simple and further
decentralized solution by the majority of the open source and
cryptographic software development community.

3. Failure to Review Existing Work: I would urge anyone to be wary of
adopting any proposal that does not inform itself through reference to
existing protocols in the same area.  In this area there are a few
protocols in current use (chiefly in Europe) such as those listed at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invoice#Electronic_invoices as well as
various hosted platforms such as http://xero.co.nz/ (chiefly
Australia/New Zealand). Often, existing work shows its age with
after-the-fact alterations that sit poorly with initial assumptions:
exactly the kind of situation one can walk in to developing against a
proposal before adequately researching the area.

4. Complexity of Metadata: Physical and digital invoicing for
businesses operating at scale often requires delivery terms, product
classification codes, locale-specific taxation (often at multiple
levels), various fees and discounts (sometimes fulfillment-speed
linked with multiple tiers/thresholds), and other features that I am
skeptical are ever going to be made fully available within a business
protocol tacked on to a hybrid digital currency/settlement system
(like Bitcoin) as a secondary concern.

5. Non-BTC Currencies/Currency-like Commodities: No approach to
non-BTC currencies appears to have been made, which makes the
&#34;invoice&#34; of limited utility for almost all businesses, save those
willing to accept all of the &#39;capital risk&#39; (exchange rate fluctuation
risk) inherent in a BTC-based fulfilment process with a potential term
long enough to justify an invoicing process. (Does this narrow scope
actually cover any existing business?)

6. DNS: As already mentioned with regards to X.509: a huge red flag as
an area of potential vulnerability, or at least information leakage.

I must now admit that in raising the above I am definitely biased.  My
employer (Payward, Inc.) and other organizations (OpenCoin, Inc.,
etc.) have been working with the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) on tabling some open proposals within this area under the
auspices of the Internet Financial Exchange Project
(http://ifex-project.org/).  Our hope is to facilitate the requisite
standardisation within internet-connected systems to deal with what is
perhaps fairly characterised as a relatively heterogeneous outlook on
the rise of cryptographic (and other alternate) currencies and
commodities, and emerging settlement infrastructures.

Whilst the current Bitcoin proposal is admirable for correctly raising
the area as one of immediate concern, I hope that the above points out
some of the perhaps as-yet unconsidered complexities and draws in to
question whether Bitcoin is in fact the appropriate place to implement
a solution, given the hassles that will entail.  After all, wouldn&#39;t
Bitcoin developer time would be better spent improving the core of
bitcoin (ie. distributed settlement system and commodity) rather than
adding new features?

I would invite parties within the Bitcoin community with an interest
in non directly settlement-linked financial transaction negotiation
and reporting features to consider contributing to the existing,
re-usable efforts at the IFEX Project, rather than supporting the
extension of one currency/commodity and settlement infrastructure (ie.
Bitcoin) which IMHO is likely to detract from developer time, increase
complexity, and perhaps result in a less polished and re-applicable
solution overall.

Our proposals:
 - X-ISO4217-A3 (X-ISO4217-A3). A published proposal that provides a
mechanism for the open identification of currencies or currency-like
commodities on the internet.  (Bitcoin is registered as XBTC).
http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3
 - Internet IBAN (IIBAN). A published proposal that provides a
mechanism for the open identification of financial endpoints on the
internet. (IBAN compatible, checksum-included, name-squatting problem
avoiding. The registry of entities is IANA-managed, encourages GPG
use, and avoids the X.509 requirement.)
http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/iiban
 - Internet MIC (IMIC). A published proposal that provides a mechanism
for the open identification of financial markets on the internet.
(Such as most Bitcoin exchanges)
http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/imic
 - Internet Financial EXchange (IFEX). A proposal under development
that facilitates the negotiation of financial transactions between
internet-based financial endpoints. (The area we would love your
input) http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/ifex

Sincerely and with the utmost respect for the Bitcoin project&#39;s excellent work,
Walter Stanish

Supporting DNSSEC/DANE in the future when they are widely deployed is a great idea.

Note that the x509chain field is &#39;repeated&#39;, and any repeated field may have zero entries. So I would suggest supporting other PKI systems in the future by adding optional new fields (for maximum compatibility or security merchants might want to include both a x509chain AND

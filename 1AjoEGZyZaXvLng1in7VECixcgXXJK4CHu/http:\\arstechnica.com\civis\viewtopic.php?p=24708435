Good article, but unfortunately the problem is still social.I can't imaging trying to get most of the people I know to use encryption, and I shudder to imagine trying to walk half of them through this. UltimaRatioRegum

Until there is a seamless, idiot-proof, "big button" solution for using PGP encryption, the fact remains that it's just too hard for your average (non-IT-professional) person to use.Online webmail providers aren't going to build it into their systems because then they wouldn't be able to mine emails for ad targeting. What's needed is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, client-agnostic, PGP encryption application. Something as easy to use as Facebook, that automatically shares everyone's public keys with all their friends and contacts, and automatically encrypts all communications. If someone gets it right they could make a fortune.

Edit: Sorry, I finished reading the article and what I wrote below is not what the story is about. The story is about encrypting the body of the message and sharing the keys and not about hosting email on their own servers.I admit I only read the first page and I feel this is great for people who host their email server on their own machines. This ensures end to end encryption without a middleman.For those of us who use an email service such as Gmail, wouldn't an easier solution be to use the POP3 settings to send all email to your local machine and have it deleted on the email server?Supposedly, the Gov can look at email that has been left on the server after 3 months, so having the emails stored locally on your machine and deleted off the hosting server is a solution to keep email out of the servers.Of course that is assuming that the Gov plays by the rules and assuming that the email hosting service really does delete email on their servers and does not hold on to deleted email indefinitely.

Why I don't bother:The concept of asymmetric encryption is appealing, but the problem for me is that I typically wipe my computer every 6 months or so, and keeping up with the key pair has proven to be remarkably challenging. Since I don't actually use the key pair for much of anything, keeping it safe while I reinstall is not something foremost on my mind. (as a power user, I tend to install an unthinkable amount of random crap constantly and I find it's just easiest to wipe the whole thing to get that fresh "new computer smell" back.)If more people I know used asymmetric key pairs, I'm sure I'd keep up with them better though. The other issue is having a Galaxy Nexus, iPod touch, nexus 10, desktop, and other small devices laying around implies a decent amount of effort to sync all of these devices up to the same key pair.Maybe someday I'll figure out a way to use this stuff, or maybe I'll write my own programs that take all the hassle out of it... who knows. Encryption is important.

I've been playing around with GnuPG for email encryption over the last week or so and have found that the biggest barrier is the difficulty in setting it up for the average user, so this writeup is great.My next biggest question: How do you your public key out there? Currently I've uploaded it to a keyserver and have a link to it in my email signature.Is there a better way?

Great article!However, until everyone (or at least, everyone you communicate with) uses encryption, there's no use for it for the average user. I'd like to use encrypted email, but sadly, unless I feel like teaching every single person I know how to read my encrypted emails, it's useless to me.The first person (or people) that makes a nice, transparent, hands-off solution for encrypted email is going to make millions.

A few things are missing from this article.There is a public infrastructure of OpenPGP public key servers.You can upload your public key there and you can fetch other people's public keys, making it easier to share.However, this does not fix the issue of trusting keys. Ie "I have this public key that says Peter Bright, but does it really belong to Peter Bright?PGP/GPG uses a web of trust model: if Alice sign's Bob's key and Bob sign's Claire's key, then Alice will trust Claire's key too.

Once it's installed, sending encrypted messages on OSX with GPGTools is *extremely easy*, since it can be done with the services menu.1) Open your mailer app of choice and compose your message.2) Select the text to encrypt (usually the whole message body), then right-click and select Services > OpenPGP:Encrypt3) From the pop-up dialog, select the public key of your recipient from your list of public keys. Optionally (but recommended), check the box to sign your message and add yourself to the recipient list so you can decrypt it yourself.4) Enter your own private key's passcode to enable GPGTools to use it to cryptographically sign your message.5) The highlighted text is replaced with ciphertext.6) Send your message. Done.

If I use outlook or thunderbird as my client to access gmail, do these methods still provide me security? It sounds like they would.But it also sounds like I couldn't access my email from anywhere but my main PC. Presumably my smart phone doesn't support GPG or S/MIME, and thats unfortunate, because its my main email client.Do password managers also support key pair/certificate storage? so that I could get lastpass or 1password on my phone (or my work PC), and use it to decrypt my mail? That would be nice.

"Since making encryption the default is in most cases impractical, most users of encrypted mail will be better served by encrypting only sensitive communications."I've got to object to that recommendation. Only encrypting "sensitive" stuff is like broadcasting "Look here! Look here!" when those persons from whom you're trying to hide your communications do end up with possession. That's especially true since the meta data is not encrypted. You're broadcasting when and where you're emailing sensitive information.If you really want to hide information but leave it on a public server you'll need to establish several different public keys and fill your inbox with mail to each. That will require the snooper to break several private keys to get to the "good stuff."

How much metadata is still exposed with these solutions? Seems like at least the recipient address would still have to be there, and probably the sending IP (though you could Tor that). Of course, when it occurred and how large a message would be visible (though you could pad a small message). If the sender identity is sufficiently hidden, I suppose that probably would be enough to inhibit building a good map of connections between senders/recipients.I'm glad nothing I do is interesting enough that I have to actually worry about these issues ;-) Actually, I did use GnuPG for sending credit card information from web servers to merchants many years ago before giving up on trying to comply with PCI myself and outsourcing CC handling.

Quote:Something as easy to use as Facebook, that automatically shares everyone's public keys with all their friends and contacts, and automatically encrypts all communicationsThe problem with anything that automatically shares/befriends/encrypts in this situation is that it might automatically or accidentally share your private key with people you don't want it to. I think that is the big issue. If your private key is in the cloud, you lose, so anything cloud/webmail style just plain doesn't work. You have to store your keys locally, or keep them encrypted, which starts to get back into 'lots of hassle' territory.That is the real problem that needs solving. Keeping your private key safe enough and accessible enough. After that, the rest is trivial.

While I'm mildly happy to see it touched on, this article felt like the authors had an axe to grind from the start and proceeded to do so with gusto. The S/MIME section in particular is spartan, which is odd given that as the authors grudgingly acknowledge it's by the far the easiest and most widespread. While later mentioning that support is built-in to mobile clients as well, no mention of how to set that up is made. Abstract "costs" are mentioned for a certificate with identity verification, but no mention of what said costs are ($60 for 2 years from StartCom, for anyone interested). Free certificates are not a problem, a quick phone call can be used for extra verification if you're truly concerned but in practice that's not something someone needs to worry about and should not be an obstacle to doing better then plaintext. "Perfect" should never be the enemy of "good" for security, since all security is a matter of economics.Finally, for communications with your own trusted parties you can also just make your own S/MIME certs and distribute them directly if you'd like (which will be both free and highly secure).Quote:In practice, using encrypted e-mail is awkward and annoying.It really isn't. Signing improves email all by itself, and thus provides a direct incremental improvement even if the other side does nothing. All mail can be signed by default with no issue, and then encrypted when possible. It's two buttons in the client. If it's under iOS at least, it's all automatic after adding the cert. It'd be absolutely fair to say that setup could be easier, but using it is easy, no one at our business has any trouble with it.Quote:Though S/MIME has been around for a long time and support is widespread both in desktop and mobile clients, its actual usage is rare.Yeah good call! "In practice, using adaptive hashes is awkward and annoying. Though bcrypt has has been around for a long time and support is universal for servers, its actual usage is rare" - said Dan Goodin never, presumably (or maybe that's your next article?). While support could certainly be improved farther, popularity is sadly a very, very poor metric for ease or importance of security.Quote:Moreover, the all-too-common not-quite-spam that many of us receive on a regular basis—mailing lists, shopping receipts, bill notifications, and so on—won't ever send encrypted mail.It could all be signed however, and that could eliminate many types of phishing and forgeries. It's also an easy way to reduce false positives in spam filtering. That even financial institutions do not sign mail is not because it's hard, it's for the same sort of reasons that many banks still require a 6-8 character alphanumeric password, a few "security questions" such as "Who was your mom?" and call it done.Quote:The process is also error-prone.What. No it's not. Is the lock shut? It's encrypted. Is the lock open? It's not. If it's not possible to encrypt, the lock will be greyed out.So yeah, disappointing all around. Secure email is one of the most convenient ways to have secure communications with another person anywhere on the world. That it's not perfect or could use more development is not a great reason to tell everyone not to bother, particularly given that improvements won't come without more demand.

The article didn't mention Tormail (an email onion within the Tor network). It's not exactly run-of-the-mill but I've got to believe it's more secure.

Yes, as mentioned, metadata isn't encrypted, only the contents are. There's other techniques to hide that you are communicating with someone at all, most of which are not useful or friendly to the everyday user. Steganography in imageboards, usenet, etc. Email being plaintext is not really a bug. Back in the day, usenet was plaintext at all. Thus evolved schemes of encoding binaries into the appropriate length and format for posting into text streams. The same applies for cryptographically signed or encrypted materials. You can then use whatever transport you want.I mostly agree with Xoa. Even just signing via your bank's certificate will reduce phishing (until some smart cookie puts something similar in the graphical HTML email, thus reducing it again to a PEBKAC problem.)

All that's happened over the last couple of weeks makes it clear to me that at least as important as it to stop people from reading the contents of email it's equally important to hid the relationships that are made apparent by it.It'd be nice to have an email client that would be contentiously adding noise to a distributed database. Whenever I wanted to send a message to someone I'd start sending an encrypted stream of data that would appear to be noise. That way anyone listening wouldn't know that a message was being sent and wouldn't know who it was being sent to.I guess it's not possible though - on some level every message has to have a to address. It doesn't really matter if it's user@domain or a 50 digit random string, you can always translate it back to the source.

What surprises me the most is that with all the resources Google has, there's a lot of potential to make really quite easy (and streamlined) within GMail. I think that would be a game changer.It just seems to me that the era of e-mail client's is over - especially with how good online editors have become (whether you love or hate MS, try Outlook.com -- it's beautiful).Regardless, +1 to the article, +2 for the explanations. Explaining assymetry and the necessity for it isn't easy.

This is what I would classify as a technology problem, not a social problem. Once the technology is streamlined enough that it only requires the click of a check box, and yet people still don't adopt it, that would be a social issue. The fact that this article needs to be three pages long, nicely illustrates how there are still too many technological hurdles for widespread adoption.

Having the messages themselves be encrypted is really the ***ONLY*** solution, for e-mail, even if you have your own personal e-mail server.The SMTP protocol used between mail servers has no encryption support. So any e-mail that goes outside whatever webmail service you use (meaning pretty much anything where the sender and receiver are not in the same domain) is subject to wholesale monitoring of the internet.

There aren't that many banks in the world, or that many PayPals, or Gmails or whatever. In practice, a solution doesn't have to be infinitely scalable to provide tremendous value. If all banks and a number of major services signed all email as a matter of course for example, it'd be perfectly possible for Microsoft/Apple/Mozilla/whomever to have a checked list, or even hardcoded list, of services where a class 3 signing cert from one of the majors is required or a matching message simply gets dumped without ever being displayed. If you know that, say, PayPal will never be sending an unsigned mail, then it's possible to be vastly more aggressive about detection and auto purging with no need to worry about false positives.Also, the "signed/encrypted" chrome exists outside the email body, and could also be made more prominent (and should be, but one step at a time).

If you want to use email in an obfuscated fashion, well now you really are talking about something that's a lot more work. All the standard warnings that come with using Tor apply just as strongly, or even more so depending on exactly how important your anonymity is since you're sending actual content. It's not impossible though to at least make sure you aren't low hanging fruit.Or I guess in many countries you could also just create throwaway accounts on free services at will and send them via war driving, though that requires significant work as well.

An option I missed is a solution for those that want to keep using web-based clients.Mailvelope is a very easy way to set up PGP: it's a Chrome extension (a Firefox addon is on its way) that will encrypt/decrypt your mails locally. It's extremely easy and works great. It's a young project though, so some things are missing: signing messages and verrifying them is not yet supported. But basic encryption works great, and the integration with any webbased client (litterelly every client: you can select any text-field on a page and encrypt the text you type in it) is really really polished.http://mailvelope.com/

E-mail encryption could be approached in two ways: user-to-user and domain-to-domain.In the user to user approach, each user would share public keys with each other, for encrypting e-mail. The challenge here is that this starts getting technical for most people and for many people e-mail is as technical as they want things to get. To change this you have to make encryption easier to use by people, especially the people who are techies - the expectation should just be click and send. Maybe we need to revisit how public keys are shared?In the domain to domain approach, domains would share a public key (maybe via a DNS record?), for encrypting e-mail on transport. This would mean any intermediate relays would not be able to see the content of the e-mail. The issue here, is while this solves the snooping relays, it says nothing to the people using the service whether the service in itself can be trusted.The ideal solution might be a combination of both solutions, but ultimately encryption, like many other security problems comes down to an issue of trust and time. How much security is good enough and how much is just being overly crazy paranoid? It is always protecting yourself from prying eyes, but still having the convenience and ease of use of the tool.

					<h3 style="text-align: center;">All things considered, you will reach Level Three&#8230;</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER ATTRACTION</h4>
<p><strong>In the beginning, there was attraction.</strong> Things attract each other because they like to be closer to some things than to others. These inherent preferences are the root of all change in the universe. Because of attraction, new things emerge.</p>
<p>You see: Sometimes <em>like</em> attracts <em>like</em> and sometimes <em>opposite</em> attracts <em>opposite</em>. When opposites attract, you’ve got a pair, a couple. That pair is now another unit and the process starts again.</p>
<p>The pair, the new unit, can attract an <em>opposite</em> or a <em>like</em>, or it can just drift along. When <em>like</em> attracts <em>like</em>, it can end there, like an oxygen molecule made up of two oxygen atoms, or it can continue to attract <em>like</em>, like a carbon atom. When things continue to attract <em>like</em>, bigger and more complex things get created.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER SELF-REPLICATION</h4>
<p>Sometimes a thing will attract enough of just the right stuff that <em>a copy of itself</em> is produced. <strong>This is self-replication.</strong> Self-replication is one of the most powerful forces in the universe because of exponential growth. One becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and <em>soon the universe is full of things</em>.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes a self-replicating thing makes a copy of itself <em>with a mistake in it</em>. <strong>The thing with a mistake will either be better, worse, or the same at making copies of itself.</strong> If it’s better, there will soon be more copies of the new thing than the old thing in the universe. The only way for new things to get created is by <em>a complex series of mistakes</em> that turn out to be better after all.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER THE EVOLUTION OF HOMO-SAPIENS</h4>
<p>We are self-replicating things. We are the result of a billion years worth of mistakes that turned out to be better after all. Yay for us!</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER COMMUNICATION</h4>
<p>One big mistake that turned out to be better after all was that, of all the animals, <strong>we alone can communicate complicated ideas</strong>. We can tell stories. We can share recipes. We can make complicated plans. Even dolphins and whales can’t do these things, we think.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS</h4>
<p>These ideas that we communicate are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>. Memes are a kind of thing. Memes live in our minds.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER MEMETICS</h4>
<p>Like all things, memes have inherent preferences; they fit better with certain things and they repel certain other things. Some memes naturally fit better in people’s minds; some memes naturally fit better with other memes. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When a group of memes fit well together and pull the strings of someone’s mouth and vocal   cords so that they pass them on to others, </strong><strong>a new, self-replicating thing gets created. </strong>This new thing is called a <em>memeplex</em>. Again we can see the power of self-replication in this: One person tells two, two tell four, four tell eight, and pretty soon the whole universe is full of people sharing the memeplex.</p>
<p>Sometimes even a self-replicating memeplex makes a mistake in copying itself (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">murphy&#8217;s law</a>!). The memeplex with a mistake in it will either be better, worse, or the same at making copies of itself. We can see the pattern: If it’s better soon there will be more copies of the new memeplex than the old in the universe. <strong>The only way for a new idea to gain acceptance is by a series of copying mistakes that turn out to be better after all.</strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER HUMAN SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF MEMETICS</h4>
<p>All our belief systems, religions, and governments are the result of a series of mistakes that turned out to be better at making copies of themselves after all.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER FILTERING AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF IDEAS</h4>
<p>Every new idea we think of immediately becomes transformed by copying mistakes that change it into something that is better at making copies of itself after all. A key part of the idea may be sacrificed to something better for copying. The only control we have over the spread of our ideas is in making them as resistant to copying mistakes as possible.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER BABIES AS MEME SPONGES</h4>
<p>When we are born, our mind is courted by meme after meme after meme, all the result of thousands of years of practice (on the part of the memes), practice at getting themselves copied into fresh new minds. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">This is Level 1:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></strong>We have our instincts, born of millions of years of our genes and bodies striving to make copies of themselves &#8212; soon our minds become filled with memes and eventually we may develop a map of life that mostly makes sense. So we start with our instincts, a body, and a developing memeplex.</p>
<p>As we grow, we learn to speak a language that we believe expresses anything we want to say. We use geometric and physical concepts that we believe explain anything we encounter. We know stories and myths that we believe relate to all of life’s trials and tribulations. <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>This is Level 2:</strong> </span>Our inherited trajectory. We have our roadmap, born of thousands of years of the memes in our minds striving to make copies of themselves.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER THE UNHINDERED MIND</h4>
<p>Each of us has a purpose here. When the memes are quiet, it is possible to feel when we are on purpose and   when we are off purpose. Conversely, when memes run the show, it is <em>the purpose of the memes</em> that gets served.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER THE POWER OF META-COGNITION</h4>
<p><strong>Once we realize that there are millions of memes battling inside our mind, there arises the possibility of influencing the outcome of that battle.</strong> Until we realize it, there is no possibility. The battle can be influenced in three ways. First, by noticing the memes. Second, by detaching from them. Third, by obtaining clarity of purpose. When these three steps are achieved, we can begin to select our memes consciously. We select memes that keep us on purpose. <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">This is Level 3:</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">Conscious Selection for a Purpose.</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER DETACHING FROM THE DISEMPOWERING MEMES</h4>
<p>A purpose is not a goal. A purpose does not feel like guilt, shame, or vengeance. Guilt, shame, and vengeance are emotions used by memes to gain mastery over your life. By choosing memes consciously, we can eliminate the control that memes have over   those emotions. A purpose feels fulfilling, satisfying, joyful, and powerful.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER WHAT YOU SHARE</h4>
<p>A purpose mostly has to do with other people. A purpose must inherently be fulfilled by spreading hardy, beneficial memes. Every time we speak, write, create, or act we are spreading memes. <strong>To fulfill our purpose we must be conscious of which memes we are spreading.</strong> Life is largely composed of conversations. Conversations are composed of memes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 1</span>,</strong> we are unaware of this.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 2</span>,</strong> we see the world as a solid, understandable body to be interacted with.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 3</span>,</strong> we see the world as a canvas to be painted, an instrument to be played, or a block of marble to be sculpted by us for our purpose.</p>
<p>We choose to do this for good or for evil. If we choose good, good is returned to us in unexpected ways. If we choose evil, evil is returned. Either way, it looks like the way we choose is the way of the world.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDER STARTING WITH YOUR VISION</h4>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 1</span>,</strong> we do not understand the world and consequently fear it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 2</span>,</strong> we replace the fear with understanding. The price of understanding is limits. Our approximate models of the universe are never completely accurate, never useful in all situations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">In Level 3</span>,</strong> we start with a vision of what we want to create. From there we choose our models.</p>
<p>Sometimes a chosen model may seem insane to the other inhabitants of the little patch of space-time we happen to occupy. No matter. Men with a vision of goodwill have often looked insane in times of mistrust and scarcity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">But in </span><span style="color: #000080;">Level 3</span>,</strong> we realize that <em>the universe is not a maze to be navigated; it is a baby to be brought up</em>. When we give it love, clarity, and opportunity, we raise a child universe to be a joyful, giving, and successful adult universe. It is only by starting in this 3rd level of consciousness, by starting with our vision, that we have the opportunity to sculpt our little patch of space-time as we see fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>*This meme shamelessly sculpted out of <a href="http://www.memecentral.com/Level3.htm">memecentral.com/level3</a></em>.<br />
**<em>May it spread far and wide.</em></span></p>

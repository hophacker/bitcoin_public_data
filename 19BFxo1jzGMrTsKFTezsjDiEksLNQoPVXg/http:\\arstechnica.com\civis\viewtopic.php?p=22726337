So umm... yea. Ser Beric Dondarrion If there's one thing Book 5 has taught us, it's that Melisandre is full of shit. She is a fanatic who is making it up as she goes along. She has no idea what is really going on, only that she has power. And because she has power, she thinks that makes her right. Either that or she's actually an agent of "The Other".

Point of order, it was actually Jon Arryn who started the rebellion. He was the one who raised his banners, rather than give Ned and Robert over to Aerys and certain death. Of course, it was the result of Ned's brother and father being put to death, after his sister disappeared with Rhaegar. But the initial act of rebellion started with Arryn.Quote:It was cold blooded how Jaime and Ned were talking about what happened to his father and brother and Ned said "And you just stood there".Basically, the entire kingdom just stood there. Everyone knew that Aerys was batshit insane. But he was the king, and as long as he wasn't directing the crazy at them, everyone just stayed quiet. Ironically, Jamie was downright heroic by killing Aerys after he gave the order to blow up Kings Landing. Yet he was still branded Kingslayer and had his honor questioned since then.Quote:She could have put on her "I forgive you for your indiscretion" routine for show and raised Jon as her own son. And probably would have, considering the value she placed on family.Plausible deniability. She genuinely hated Jon for being Ned's bastard. That meant that there was no question that he was Ned's bastard. Plus, I'm guessing that Ned's promise to Lyanna overruled any devotion to his own wife (who, at that time, he hardly even knew).

This is also how I got through Wheel of Time a second time, since I'm pretty sure I would not have had the patience to re-read those books.

Quote:Would you trust Catelyn to be smart and keep a secret?Well to be honest, Martin's presentation of Catelyn at the beginning of book 1 is of a pretty sane woman who is smart, respectable, thoughful, honorable, and all sorts of other positive superlatives, and the only thing that gets under her skin is Jon himself. So yeah, you would think so. In fact, she might not hate Jon viscerally if he said something like, "I didn't cheat on you."Then you read further and see how Martin changes the characters drastically over time. I wouldn't trust anyone in his world with any secret more important than, "I really have to fart," in a public place.Quote:Yet he was still branded Kingslayer and had his honor questioned since then.I think his still wearing the white had something to do with that...

As we get to know the character better from multiple points of view and their own, we start to see the flaws/etc.

Ep 2 spoiler:
Spoiler: show
Really didn't like the deviation from the books at the end there. Why would Craster risk being seen handing a baby to a White Walker when the place is riddled with Crows? Hell, why would a Walker go there, apparently alone? It doesn't make sense. I guess they didn't want to show Jon just taking his orders and moving on like he should have. The only good thing about it is that it provides a nice counterpoint to how he treated Gilly versus how he reacted to seeing the baby. That was very much like his father - disregard the women, save the children!

Everyone despised the Mad King and everyone despises his killer. The hypocrisy is so thick you could cut it with a knife. But it goes deeper than that.Here you have a feudal society, with the strongest conceivable implementation of "might makes right", but everyone crows about "honor" and "law" and "sworn oaths". Every asshole with an army to his name lays claim to the throne, and everyone else is impugning the legitimacy of their claim with one side of their mouth and with the other conceding that there is no justness to the whole affair to begin with and the strongest army will win in the end. "He's not the heir because incest!" "He's not the heir because I'm older!" "He's not the heir because I have more troops!" (At least Renly was honest.) "I want to secede because I don't like the Lannisters!" "I want the kingdom because I have dragons and long ago my forefather conquered your lands and somehow that gives me legitimacy!"The whole thing--popular opinion in the books in general and popular opinion on who is and is not honourable in particular--is a farce, and I can't see how it could be anything other than an intentional reflection of real life. And like in real life, with a farce of this magnitude you can sink in the depths of jaded impotent frustration, or you can laugh. I expect I'll be laughing my ass off by the time the series is done.In other news, Lady Olenna Tyrell makes a great first impression.

I thought when Ned was killed - I suppose Robert too - that Martin was aiming to tell a multi-generational story, and that Robb, Jon, Bran, and possibly their children would be the real protagonists. Instead, he has shown a remarkable commitment (and possibly relish) to screwing over the "good guys" in as many ways as possible, with no trace of the usual humor or sympathy that makes it an enjoyable fan experience. Why follow the series to its end? Don't get me wrong- I will, as I enjoy the world setting and his writing is perfectly comfortable- but I'm not interested in investing any great emotion in the characters anymore.I'm only halfway through book 4 at this point, and I've tried to dodge around spoilers in this discussion, but it seems that Martin isn't winning back any of your hearts. I've had a couple of good rants with myself in the car about Cersei and Sansa. Joffrey was horrible, but I had a strong sense he would not be allowed to live. I also fantasized for a while about exterminating the Freys.I am holding out hope for Arya, although she seems pretty broken. Where is her wolf? Will they be reunited into some crazy fighting team? Was Syrio really killed in King's Landing? I'm pretty scared for Brienne- she has all the hallmarks of the tragic hero, and Martin is unflinching in his abuse of good characters.I like the Onion Knight too- I'm not sure exactly what has happened to him, but I hope he isn't just discarded.Finally, can one of these newfound magic users forge a replacement hand for Jaime? Make sure it's after his self-examination and redemption are complete, so he doesn't backslide.

I suppose I should add that I took some medieval European history in college, and I can see that the author seems keen to point out that many of the "winners" in our own history were the scoundrels. This idea has merit, but it doesn't mean it will add up to enjoyable fiction. Bernard Cornwell wrote a bleak and painful Arthur story in his "Winter King" trilogy, but he did an admirable job (at least in hindsight) of putting good characters through grisly and painful situations without turning me off as the reader.

Meefer: I believe his original plan was to have a 5 year gap so that the children could become the proganists. He has abandoned that obviously.Quote:I like the Onion Knight too- I'm not sure exactly what has happened to him, but I hope he isn't just discarded.See I never get why people think Martin only kills good characters. The fact that Davos has made it a fair distance proves this idea to be a simple case of selection bias.

Not even just the protagonists, but anyone at all. So yeah, I like Davos and hold out little hope for him. Or Arya. Or Tyrion. Or even Jaime, I mean, he's gotten too likeable to survive, surely.And when you're looking at the series like that, it doesn't invite you in, to say the least.

Had it been Robert, or Ned, or Tywin, nobody would've flinched - but Jaime, even though he's the son of a great lord, simply didn't rank high enough.

Andy: it's not that I think he only kills off good characters. It's that it's unusual to do so much of it- where it's completely normal to see the bad guys get what's coming to them. My problem as a reader is that I get tired of being let down as I cheer for the characters I like Speaking of which, I was cheering on the Hound as a good candidate for redemption when he mostly disappeared from the story. I'm hoping he makes a comeback.I'm discovering that I'm more of a softie than I thought.

That does not lead me to believe that Martin's world is a realistic portrayal of our world. For instance, the Freys and the Red Wedding. In real life, that would either never have happened, or they'd have paid a heavy price for it. As a race we've shown that we only tolerate traitors when they help us, then we quickly remember that they are traitors and we punish them. There are very few traitors, and none that I can think of on that scale, that were rewarded in the long term for being traitors. It would be more realistic if the Lannisters had hung the elder Frey up and then either confiscating his lands, or hanging the other Freys until they get to one they trust to be their tool. You don't leave an asshole like that in charge where there same thing could happen to you. Not when you're as cold and heartless as the Lannisters.And when you talk about jockeying and backstabbing, how the hell has the eldest Frey stayed in power? That's where I would expect the sniveling weasels to have more effect.That's just my opinion, of course, but the lack of repercussions for the Red Wedding in particularly I have found really bothersome.

Remember Frey let Rob pass on the promise to marry one of his daughters so he basically threw his lot in with Rob. But then with Rob's breaking that promise, he worked with Tywin to exact revenge and prove to Tywin that he changed sides (particularly since he knew that if the Red Wedding was 'successful' that the North would probably fall apart and the Lannisters would be the winners). Frey knows that once the Red Wedding happens, there's no way anyone in the North will deal with him again and, very likely, they will seek revenge of their own so he has to be on the winning side. Frey has always been a wild card, though... remember he 'showed up late' at the big battle from Robert's campaign, etc. Catelyn warns Rob/others several times that Frey cannot be trusted, etc.

The Red Wedding is based on an actual event if I'm not mistaken. And Frey (elder) Frey cares only about Frey. Even other members of his own weirdo family are held in contempt if they talk out of turn or disagree with him. He will get his, hopefully they trebuchet him over the twins.

You know, I was thinking about how bad to the ass Robb was in the season opener and I am really looking forward to people seeing him as the only "Good guy" left and rooting for him watching the TV series. I'm thinking that the Red Wedding will be an even bigger shock than Ned being killed.

That means that people have to abide them. That doesn't mean that anyone has to like or trust them. They seem to be in their own little world, that everyone else is happy to confine them to.

I think in Martin's universe, there's no greater sin than breaking the peace/truce after you've offered food/broken bread. It's basically Craster's only other law besides "no sctupping my wivedaughters". The Freys aren't just despised, they're probably openly hunted, or soon will be. They'll be exterminated.

If you hadn't noticed, the Freys *are* getting their just deserts. Their "allies" let them die and don't really shed a tear, other than in mock protest. Spoiler: show
they even got baked into a meat pie
Old Frey probably knew it would happen, too. He just didn't care because he's got plenty more Freys where those came from and he's not exactly going to go out and about where his own neck is at risk. He holds the crucial river crossing and there's a war on. Whoever "the winner" will be will have no choice but to tolerate him....so he thinks. River? Meet dragon. Pont

Quote:No-one else can build bridges in this universe?Not during war time. Not during winter. And when it's summer and peace time, why bother, because it's cheaper just to pay the Freys.Also, their location is important. If you start building a bridge near them, you'd have to start with the fortresses on either side, or the Freys would just come and burn it while you were building it.

They reigned for a few hundred years and had dragons to do their burninating for them, right?

I got the impression that it's a fuck-off big river. There aren't two crossings for the same reason there aren't two Golden Gate bridges. It was probably an engineering marvel for its time.

It would make sense to artificially prop up a house that is loyal to the throne and a crossing that they solely control. It makes sense to make sure this one house is loyal to you, and have that strategic point they alone control on your side.

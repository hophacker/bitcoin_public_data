Decided to start uploading gameplay again since my 'net isn't strong enough to stream. Dota 2: Doom Edition [1]Dota 2: Lich Edition [1]Dota 2: Phantom Assassin Edition [1]Had a fantastic match last night as SF, but forgot to record it. I may go back and commentate it at some point. It's been nice running with full 5's lately, because it's people I know (or friends of people I know) and they tend to take things a lot less seriously, and have actual fun playing.

Liking Bristleback so far. He is really hard to kill and a massive pain in the arse to play against.I'm beginning to think Kunnka is OP. If he gets any carry going he's unkillable and does monster damage.

I have yet to see a Bristleback that was worth anything. Maybe it's just that they don't know the hero, but even in early laning he hasn't been much of an issue (even with his snot bubbles).Also..Gentlemen, The war has begun. Time to declare a side.

I gotta at least somewhat agree on Kunkka. He's like a semi-hard carry with an easy start. His cleave is redonculous early. You can dodge it, but it takes a lot of work, and it basically reduces your CS to almost nothing in order to pull it off.And late, he just gets more and more powerful. Maybe not as exponential as some of the other hard carries, but definitely tough. I've had some absolutely horrible games early as Kunkka, and still managed to become godlike near the end.

Yeah, early on the cleave is just horrible. It's bad if you're ranged, it's a fucking disaster if you're melee.

Had a great game on viper last night...that we lost. I got first blood, went back and forth ganking and killing my middle opponent (Zues). But we did not play as a team, people were KSing (or blaming each other, Magnataur was mad I "KS'ed" him with my normal attack) etc. I was doing great but we just did not mesh well. Was a pretty good game but would have been nice to have a little teamwork and for people to learn to focus the right people first (that being NOT Brewmaster...) and using their abilities - Alchemist was our "main" stun (I think so anyways, we had Lina and Mags as well but one has a delay and the other is an ult) and did not take UC until 12 or so.I am all about people playing their heroes the way they want but why you'd totally ignore one of the best stuns in the game in favor of a little more gold early on...arg. Sad thing is Alch is a decent PL counter but he went Moljinor instead of Radiance so we ended up getting overwhelmed with images.

It goes pretty far forward, but if you're off to the side a bit you can avoid it. Unless the Kunkka is smart and purposely lines you up. It's really really hard to dodge it unless you're really far away if he's actively trying to hit you with it. But if he's just attackign the creep with it and not paying attention you can stand to the side usually.K0DE wrote:Had a great game on viper last night...that we lost.

Yep, sounds like bad teamwork... I know Magna can kind of be a carry as well, but come on, it's nice if Viper gets fed.And that Alch was probably using Dota2alttab.com. One of the dangers of rigidly following a build. Last I remember, they tell you to pick a lot of the gold levels early, because if you're good with alchemist, and you're not getting harassed too badly, you can bank a lot of money and get your radiance early. If you're not familiar with him though, it's better to go acid and stun. I think that's a poor build on dota2alttab personally. Because if a person is good with him, they'll already know to get the gold so they can rush radiance, but if they're not good at him and don't know his abilities (and consequently will be looking at a site for build info) then it's not a great idea.

Why the fuck do idiots run towards Roshan's spawn as soon as they see their opponents have killed him??? "Holy shit, our opponents are much stronger than they used to be, now's the perfect time to kill them because I know where one of them is!"

If you do nothing about them getting Roshan, you're letting them do what they will with the 200 gold and you're letting them plan the encounter to use the Aegis. Sometimes you can catch 1-5 of them not at full health and not in the best position to fight that fight, and basically make them blow the gold on deaths and the aegis immediately, nullifying the Rosh kill.However that plan can easily backfire if you misplay it or force it from too far away, hence the double-edgedness andyfatbastard

I think the vast majority of the time all 5 of them are there and you get roflstomped. Much, much better to just make note of who picked up the Aegis and get on with whatever you were doing IMO. Sorry, that rant was brought to you by a team that were right behind me about to push mid tower, then Rosh died and suddenly I was alone and didn't realise until it was too late. 15 seconds later our whole team is dead. I'm really liking Spectre at the moment. OK she is a very hard carry but when played right she can devastate teams. The hard part is getting her geared up. I love how you can just glide through trees and cliffs for a gank.

Good games last night. Won two, and then my accidental inclusion of AR into the mix cost us the third. I think I'm done with AR. It always seems like the opposing team gets the perfect hero setup while we get stuck with 5 carries or no CC. Just like RNG heroes man, if I didn't have bad luck I'd have no luck at all.Which is funny because I usually random in AP and get good heroes. Xerofayte

My favorite part was when they were chasing me around the trees trying desperately to kill me, and between my sprites and urn they just couldn't do it, then yall came up from behind and just murderlated them.

I repicked this game up on the weekend, as I had requested some vacations from work, and damn I had a blast.One of the most fun games I've had was a SD when I just blindly picked Razor. Ended up with Sven on top against Drow and Faceless Void; they started harrassing pretty early (damn you frost arrows), but then I managed to get the grip of Razor and then proceeded to keep them away with static link. They try to gank me, Sven just stuns them and starts to attack FV, what happens when he jumps and tries to escape? Plasma Field , after that he proceeded to make some very poor decisions when trying to kill me, that usually ended on me Plasma Fielding his escapes. The straw that broke the camel's back was late-game when he used chronosphere on me while I had the Static Link on him, the dmg reductions makes him unable to kill me, chronosphere ends, I pop the Ult as his teammates (and mine) were getting closer and then? you guessed it, Plasma Field, the poor sod managed to get hit 3 times by it while trying to escape and drops dead. He immediately D/C's after that it was just a walk in the park. Mine were only lucky shots, the real carry for our team was our QoP, she killed almost everything she had on her sights

I've been smashing it with Spectre recently. She requires a very specific strategy to be effective, but when it comes off she's a beast. Her ultimate is so good early game. You can just rack up kills and the associated gold by teleporting straight to any enemy hero unlucky enough to find themselves with low health.Race to a Vanguard and you become pretty hard to kill. Then a Diffusal Blade to massively increase the effectiveness of your ulti. Then if you can get the gold together for a Radiance your ulti will be an I Win Button.

I was fond of the way Treant was used and what it could mean for the (professional) metagame going forward. Living Armor not just as teamfight protection but also to completely shut down early and midgame split-push. Early 4-man tower commitments don't seem to be en vogue anymore outside of Na'Vi. Treant can singlehandedly deflect those 1- and 2-hero pushes when there's an engagement in another lane.

After taking a bit of a break from Dota because of other distractions (life, Star Conflict, Bioshock: Infinite), I've made my way back to playing over the last week to... well, very limited success.I just can't figure out what I can do to make myself and my team better during the course of a match. It seems that people just want to rage and do stupid shit throughout the course of a match, and either I have a really good game where the rest of my team just seems to work against the goal of winning, or my team is decent but I just seem to have a horrible game.Honestly I think I'd just rather play with you guys at this point more often than not, because at least we'd know what to expect from each other and might have a little better ability to turn the tide than my solo-queuing ass. But I barely ever see any of you on at the same time I am, or you're already in matches when I get online.

I vowed I wouldn't play 5-man stacks because there is too much try hard pub stomp out there. But lately I have been playing 5-man and it has been great. Yeah we have been rolled a few times, but I have found the matches to be much better and way more fair as of late. Not sure if its the ranking system getting better or opponents getting worse Mortus

It helps that the 5-man's I've been rolling with are entertaining to play with. Even if we're losing I'm still having fun. That's the problem with solo queue. You get one rager and the morale of the entire team just tanks. Even a win is unfulfilling.

I agree with the moral thing. DotA is tough on losers but you can make some serious combacks too... Not to mention the people who bitch at supports for having mediocre records or being behind in levels (one of my wins this weekend my team wanted to know why I was always missing team fights on Ice Maiden, spent the entire game trying to catch them. She is soooo slow).I also can't stand it when people prolong a game just to get more items/scores (or do crap like run away when they might die even though strategically they should go all in). Or carries who bitch about team make up. We had a Luna bitch the other day about how picking Dazzle cost us the game. I got first blood, 2nd blood and then the other team rage quit after she went AFK at the fountain before the creeps started spawning. Not sure if that was cool or crappy.Had mostly good games this weekend and I got to be a superstar in TWO of them. 'Fresher + Scepter warlock was fun. I got "overaggresive" at the end but at that point it was not a risk (on warlock, I think 4 of my deaths were in the last 90 seconds of the game). Pushed top's 2nd tower > Base tower > Raxx & then went bot and did the same. Pretty fun.Figured out Storm this week to, which is nice. I remember when he was introduced in All Stars but never really got a feel for how to play him. Puddin Pop!

Storm Spirit is so much fun to play, but is so easy to counter. My problem is juggling his overload because half the time I can't see the sprite for it when I'm going into a teamfight. I think if I played him a lot more I could get quite good at him though as he's kind of my style.

40" screen... Lucky! I have a 27" dual monitor setup. Nice to have a guide on one screen (or youtube/pandora) and the game on the other, but I still want a bigger screen. I haven't played in like 2 weeks or more! That's a long time for me. Haven't even seen Bristleback, except in a Fails of the Week video. I noticed there wasn't a changelog last week... Don't tell me they switched to a bi-weekly schedule, they've done this a couple times now it seems like.

Uploading last night's NP match. That was a fun one. I kinda screwed up jungling early (didn't take enough clarity pots), but luckily my fast ring of basilius was enough to keep my mana up just enough to spawn more treants when the previous batch fell.

I gave DOTA2 a try.And it is like it tries to be a terrible game.First: It took 20 minutes to find a match. Second: The match consisted of the enemy team was a 5 man fighting 5 random people and screaming "50 KILLS OR WE DON'T END IT N****ERS" but there is no surrender option. Third: The mechanics around leaving/AFKing/punishment/etc are completely unexplained in game.Fourth: Limited number of reports, after reporting all 5 people for racial slurs I found out I couldn't report the next idiot I ran into.It is clear Valve put a lot of thought into the game mechanics and the client, but none into dealing with DOTA's shitlord playerbase.

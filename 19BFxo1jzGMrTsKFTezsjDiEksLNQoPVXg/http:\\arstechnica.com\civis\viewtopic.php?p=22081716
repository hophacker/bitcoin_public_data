^ The first one of those ladder shenanigans seems pretty reasonable, actually. I'd stand on it. The second one, OTOH... Hellburner

Working stairwells is a bear, it comes down to using any ladder that you can get to fit any which way you can.The second one is the province of the young & dumb, the guy looks older so he should know better.

I won't even go up a ladder that's positioned "safely". If god had meant me to be raised that far off the ground, he wouldn't have made me 5'9".I can see, logically, how the first is safe enough (at least, as safe as a ladder can be, which is to say, not very). I still wouldn't go on it, but it's not really introducing any failure modes that a ladder used normally doesn't have.But the second? What the fuck? How the fuck can anyone think that's a reasonable thing to do?

Trust me, people do stupid things thinking they're reasonable all the time (edit: obviously there are plenty of better examples, but fuck Rick Perry... with a pineapple)

Have to say it's always depressing when looking at the results of any gun buyback. Hard to tell exact models from that pic, but I see what appears to be an old Colt and a British Webley, both antiques, likely with extensive histories and could probably be sold for a lot more than a refurbished Dell. And they're just going to be melted down for scrap.

If someone said "give up your means of exercise of free speech in exchange for a machine and some vocational training" everyone would think it was nuts.But speak against giving up the means to bear arms in exchange for a machine and some vocational training and only '2nd amendment types' can possibly have any objection and of course they can be conveniently dismissed...I call double standard.Especially when it results in people selling stuff that's worth more than a refurbished laptop for less. Way to take advantage of the poor and gullible.

Quote:Others are more critical. "He should be teaching people how to program," one person in the tech nonprofit community told me recently. "Teaching tech support skills is a waste of time and resources. Instead of giving people the skills needed to land high-paying tech jobs, Lance is teaching them how to put a tie on and become tech butlers."Whoever this person was, tell them I said to take their snobbery and fuck off. Thanks.

Just as the first poster pointed out the couple of guns that have value are antiques. Not the type of gun used in shootings. Some of the others that I can see, are really cheap junk. Again, what is causing the problems...No one is more of a "Second Amendment advocate" than I am. (I'm a Life Member and will be upgrading to Benefactor soon.) However, I believe in freedom. However misguided I think that his actions are... If this is what he wants to spend his money on, let him.

I'd say the latter value well outweighs any intrinsic value of the weapon being melted down.

Hmm. Those computers could be used to violate the DMCA or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act! It would probably be socially responsible to conduct a computer buyback, give away free firearms, and melt the computers down. Run in cooperation with the police, of course.

Well. I hope those laptops can do double duty as shields for the defenseless. The real criminals won't bring their guns. The real criminals can't boot a laptop up, only stealing them.

It is sad that an article with very little to do about guns, is craped on by the "Gun Nuts" in the comments. Something I would have expected from a Fox "News" trash job, but not in Ars's comments.This is not to say that their are not good arguments on both sides, just that the pro-rights side is particularly vocal, and vile. They seem to attack anything that does not 100% toe their party line. Including any basic regulation. For instance including fire arm misuse as a disqualifies for background checks, funding for studies on gun violence, buy back programs, and universal back ground check requirements.

While I find the whole concept of gun buy-backs to be dubious, I find this man's efforts to help his community to become more connected as admirable. The more in-touch we make the sectors of our society with cyclic poverty, the more chance those individuals may have to pull themselves out of it. As for the concept of the gun buy-back, I submit to you this quote from a 2004 study from the National Research Council"The theory on which gun buy-back programs is based is flawed in three respects. First, the guns that are typically surrendered in gun buy-backs are those that are least likely to be used in criminal activities... Second, because replacement guns are relatively easily obtained, the actual decline in the number of guns on the street may be smaller than the number of guns that are turned in. Third, the likelihood that any particular gun will be used in a crime in a given year is low." - Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review ( 2004 ) by the National Research CouncilThe relevant portion can be seen online given a proper search query

Baltimore's problem: drug lords. Legalize drugs, treat addiction as a medical, not criminal, issue, and high schoolers won't get fooled into thinking that joining the drug trade is a good career. Not to mention violence will drop.

Wow. Just wow.This article is about tech education for the disadvantaged, which is a deep, complex issue. I looked forward to reading comments from the Ars community regarding the pros and cons of different approaches to education, based on personal experience and institutional knowledge of the community.Instead, within the first few comments, the gun types have hijacked the discussion. Is gun ownership such a huge part of your personal self-identity that you can't read the word "gun" in a tech article without feeling the need to get on your soapbox to pontificate?Before I'm accused of being a gun fearing liberal, I say this as a former US Army infantryman who owns several firearms. Please. No one needs nor wants to hear the same old arguments about gun ownership in the commentary on this article.

There's a reason you see precious few modern weapons in that picture, and it's not because the real criminals can't afford them.

It's not like we're nitpicking a single sentence here.As for the rest, I'm all for his philosophy of going for certifications over more academic training. We're talking about educating the uneducated poor, you have to give them something practical within their capabilities. I'd love for everyone to have a Computer Science degree, but that's just not realistic.

A few things....The part where the author mentioned the name of the certification as Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, is only applicable to Windows 2003 at this point. MCSE now means Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (source: http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us ... rview.aspx).I share some of the author's enthusiasm for this project, but mentioning twice in one page about the Second Amendment groups having their wrath drawn doesn't really add to the story, it just makes it look overly partisan. At least cite some sources if you insist on keeping those references.I agree with Coy on some levels. The first is about certs. Certs mean nothing without experience. That is where the data center will really come in. Get some $100 HP servers off of eBay and load them up with VMWare ESXi and start building labs with Windows 2012 trials (with rearming they can last as long as a school year). Throw on Linux and some IOS labs. Yes, 97% of the First world will be consuming mobile products at some point, but someone needs to run the backbone.The second issue I saw was also related to something Coy said. When I look at job listings, I see a lit of programming and software analyst positions. With that in mind, he should really look at adding that to the curriculum. Lastly, I don't see a single mention of database design and administration. This is a very large oversight. Diversity is important. I don't see a lot of domestic companies shipping people across the company to manage a Windows environment.

Some of the guns in that photo are Saturday Night Specials--frequently used in armed robberies and the like--but the long guns and the single-action revolvers pictured are another matter.

I know no disadvanted man would EVER steal a laptop. Nor a gun to get a laptop. That was point one. Point two is that disadvantaged people sometimes live in shitty areas, and need those guns to save their lives. Yesterday a man came in my place of business, he had been stabbed 14 or so times, his gun saved his life. This guy definitely would have traded his gun, he was that poor.

I then illustrated that point with some examples.And, just because the article has the word gun in its title does not mean it is about gun control. Yet the second poster decides to go off about the 2nd amendment rights.

I hope this guy is successful. Certs may get outdated, and they're not always the most interesting ways for people to share their technical skills, but they WORK. You can get a job out of high school -- if you have the certs. It's not as easy as if you have a degree, but with neither... good luck. Plus, real experience running a datacenter? Super useful, even if you eventually graduate to the level where you're not working the datacenter anymore.I look forward to seeing more positive results from DAS. Here's hoping Baltimore can join the tech-elite cities of the world!

Sean thinks there are two groups here. The first group is the "traditional power base" - local government, local business community. This is the group Lucas has more of a connection to (hence the "insider"). The second group is composed of "angel investors and the tech startup community". Those two groups have very different cultures, ways of doing things, expectations, you name it. It's not a black/white thing - if anything it's more of a techie/non-techie thing. It sounds like the practical tech guys think they detect the stench of "marketing" on him.

The analogy is retracting something you've said in return for a laptop, with the understanding that if you feel like it, you can say it again later. People who voluntarily hand in a gun for a laptop are not giving up the right to own guns, they are just giving up a particular gun. To make it absolutely clear how absurd your analogy is, I would happily give someone a donut for a laptop, but I would not give up my right to eat.

No. If someone told you if you shut your mouth for 30 minutes & they'd give you a laptop, I'd doubt you'd be complaining.While I think this is a positive movement to try & change the minds of youth that are not yet totally swayed by crime, I doubt this trading scheme will accomplish much other than to act as a pawnbroker for guys with old rusty guns.

Goodness gracious, this thread went downhill pretty quick. (As expected; let's be honest, the title and article are fodder.)While I philosophically applaud the initiative, these type of "trade ins" usually amount to a symbolic gesture and have no true impact on gun violence. (I mean, come on, do you actually think gun-toting criminals give two shits about this program? I would be shocked that even 1% of active criminals would even have this on their radar.)This is coming from someone who used to be on the job. As much as I wish that these efforts can make a difference, I honestly don't believe that they will. That being said, I'm all for community activism and social change. I'm just reticent to promote these types of initiatives as truly pragmatic and worthwhile.

I think classes to teach computer literacy are ultimately shortsighted. You're trying to fix the effects of the problem, and not the cause. Computer literacy needs to be included in every single content area, and that takes two things. One is more technology in the classroom (not better and newer, we just need internet access and enough horsepower for basic software suites) and that just requires a lot of money, the traditional computer lab should be a thing of the past. This would allow students to frequently do things like analyze the patterns of immigration in response to anti-immigration laws in social studies, analyze large sets of data in math class, do group annotations of a text in English (and provide an automatic translation for English Language Learners), use Adobe products in art, and it could dramatically expand science education in every direction.The other is better teacher education programs, I'm in a very well-regarded teacher prep program, and I might stab someone if I hear anything else about smartboards, prezi, glogster, webquests, or popplet. Basically, every piece of technology is style over substance. The educational tech industry is constantly creating new tools to display content, instead of convincing teachers to use those tools to interact with the material and then teaching teachers how to use those tools. The truly ignorant elected officials on the schoolboard think this is progress. It's gotten so bad that one of the rich districts near me has started giving out tablets to all their students without keyboard attachments.

If your going to try building cloud apps, some prior knowledge of networking will help you to understand what is going on underneath those API calls. After spending a few years with MS-DOS, when I tried my hand at web server cgi-scripts with Perl, I saw the headers were being passed as environment variables. I already knew how they worked, and that made for easier troubleshooting. A budding developer with the knowledge to install/manage tools and servers on a system, and the ability to configure multiple systems to work to some end on a network, has a valuable model that will help grease their way along. Knowing how port forwarding works will help when you jump into sockets programming.Some of the software being taught will be outdated in a few years, but many of the underlying concepts evolve slower, and will still be useful for many of those who go on to pursue a development track. Even "black box" level knowledge of the system is good, because once you begin to study code there will be anchors in the brain to relate to what the code is doing.

I dunno, I want to be on Lucas's side, but with lines like "I have a three-page document that can certify you in Word today" and "his organizations' websites are replete with typos and far from slick" make him sound like a big huckster with good connections. It's great to want to engage the underprivileged, but the cynical part of me has a hard time believing this guy's intentions are pure. I'm more with Coy on this one -- they should be teaching valuable skills, not pumping out certification statistics.

The overall point of a gun trade in isn't to get all the guns off the street. Its considered perk but its not the overall goal. The purpose is to attempt to change the culture. The hopes that people see their neighbors giving up their guns for education or laptops is supposed to add a perceived value of education within the community. Because its pretty obvious a criminal with a gun can easily get a laptop by force. Many low income-high crime areas do not value education and the kids in schools are discouraged by their peers to excel in an educational fashion. It is an extremely large issue and programs like this attempt to change that culture. No one is trying to take away your second amendment right here.

"If someone told you if you shut your mouth for 30 minutes & they'd give you a laptop, I'd doubt you'd be complaining."I suppose that it would depend upon the laptop....

Thanks.Indeed. Not all geeks need to be coders, after all. Sadly, though, this is an all-too-common refrain when in reality these "tech butler" jobs are generally pretty well paying, especially for someone who'd otherwise be working at minimum wage. If nothing else, it gets their feet wet in the tech arena.I'm one of those tech butlers. I make twice the median income for my state - before bonuses and perks. I've written a few application, but I certainly wouldn't want to try to make a living at it. Read the comments in most Ars articles to see what a high-stress, low-reward career that is.As far as this guy's program is concerned, I would call it a failure. The results show that almost none of those people came in for a new oppportunity. At least half of the people who signed up for classes won't show up, because they just thought signing the paper would get them some kind of brownie points. They brought in a gun (which may have been stolen), and got a free laptop so they can go to McDonalds and look at YouTube or porn on the free wifi.

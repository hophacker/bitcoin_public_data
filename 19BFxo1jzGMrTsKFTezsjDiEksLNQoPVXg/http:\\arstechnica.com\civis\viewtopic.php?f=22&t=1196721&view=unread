I realized too late that I forgot to change the metatags on the MP3 file, so it may pop up with a completely inane cover art due to the intro song I used. Speaking of which, we should come up with a spiffy cover art of our own. Or not, I don't know. Maybe we should actually become competent at making the podcast first. Blacken00100

Attempting to download now, looks like it will be a few months before it finishes. Should give you enough time to get Ep6 ready Kosuno

Any chance of adding an episode content summary on the OP?

You mean we have to remember what we talked about? Crap. Let's see...there was me sucking at Dwarf Fortress, Rainbow Six: Ghost Recon, the PS4, my large hands...what else. Hmm...oh yeah, talked a bit about digital downloads vs the old retail boxes where you got goodies.

Seems silly, but even though I can't listen to this right now I'm looking forward to it enough that a 'teaser' like that would be appreciated.Do you guys go into each episode with a topic list? Even if you get sidetracked, something like that would be cool. Bonus points if someone takes notes w/ timestamps with the intention of a true content list. Even a couple line summary along the lines of your reply is nice to see.

We have a vague idea of what we want to talk about, but no more than that. We tried the topics-going-in thing and it was stilted and lame.

Honest, when I put them in their volume matched our voices without fail. So obviously Blacken sabotaged it.

What happened to Episode 4??? Yes, I read the show notes, and I still want to know, dammit.Good episode, still together-ish enough that people can follow along, but still random enough that it's lacking about as much organisation and coherence that it works almost like my brain pan.I had a geek boner when I am very happy that you guys mentioned Ghost Recon Online, because so few people are in the game, and it's one of those rare online games where BOTH my sexual orientation and my mother's choices in sexual partners have yet to be questioned.I'm also glad that the discussion around Mortus' hands didn't start moving towards something else. WOuld have been good laughs, but- awkward.Keep it up guys! Starting to like these more and more

Episode 6 is in the can. Let us all now peer-pressure Mortus into his editing.

Editing complete. Let us now counter-peer-pressure Blacken to upload the thing to his Feedburner. And to give me cookies.

So we just couldn't wait for the next episode (also Mortus is faster at editing than I am), so here's Episode 6 to make love to your earballs. We talk Star Conflict, me getting lost in a parking lot, Ghost Recon, SimCity (but who hasn't), free-to-play games, and awkward pauses.And more Mortus Sucks At Dwarf Fortress! He really does.(Fair warning: mic trouble this week and we get a little saucy at times. We have a plan for next week to address this a little better.)Episode 6

Really enjoyed that. Could happily listen to you guys talk about Dwarf Fortress for hours.I take it Brazilian Dota players on US servers are similar to Russians in EU?

RU? RU?" and also if they do that regardless whether they're playing DOTA or any other game. And then if someone responds, they manage to flood the entire chat log with Russian despite being the only two people in the server at the time who speak it.

So far I've only listened to about a quarter, but at the intro music. I really don't want to know what ya'll were doing prior to taping to warrant cheesy-70's-porno music. Blacken00100

When you guys were talking about how long a game should be able to run all I could think about was the deus ex meme. Somewhere someone is reinstalling right now

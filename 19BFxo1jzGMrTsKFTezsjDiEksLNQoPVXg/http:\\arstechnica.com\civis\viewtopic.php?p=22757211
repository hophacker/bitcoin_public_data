It's always a hard process and I sympathize with that but I guess in this case it helps to have read the books beforehand in order to lend the movies more realism. Without the background some of it just seems random and illogical.

Saw the movie last night, and I liked it. The only thing that bothered me was the use of shakycam to obscure the violence. I wish the bluray would have a pg18 cut without all the shaky cam.The movie reminded me of The Running Man, and also the Truman Show. Camera's everywhere in the forest and a lot of manipulation by the directors of the game.It's a long movie, but I was never bored. It could easily be expanded into a TV series.

Saw the film, liked it. Got the impression that there were layers and meanings hidden away that may come in later movies, but from what I'm reading here it seems they may just lie in the books. I guess I'll have to read them. I thought the main actress was beautiful, but a little too beautiful for where she's supposed to have came from. Someone less pretty and much more tough looking would have been more suitable. But I didn't mind staring at her that much...

I remember reading The Lottery for an English final in high school.Anyway, saw Hunger Games last night. Good movie and I maintain that opinion even after reading all of this thread.

Rise, thread, from your grave and do my bidding.....I finally saw this movie in a theater. I enjoyed.My reason for resurrecting this thread is to ask those who have read the books this question*:What keeps the kids from killing themselves or others in sorrow/defiance before they get into the arena? All I could think about when Katniss in on the train was her breaking a bottle and stabbing the Female Pimpernel in the neck, followed by setting the train on fire with the liquor, because she is a pissed-off teenager with strength, speed and some skills in killing things who is going to die anyway.* No. I did not read this whole thread. I figured there was an easy answer to this from the fans but I couldn't Google it.

Basically, the not-very-subtle threat that doing so would result in the government killing your family and friends.

In Katniss' case she kind of has to go along - she's volunteering so they don't take her sister.

That's what I thought. I didn't see anyone intimate that in the film.Re: Katniss. That's true.

Also they are very closely monitored at all times. There was even a force field or fence on the roof of their building to prevent jumpers. But mainly it is the threat of reprisal against family and even your whole district.They did learn from when she shot an arrow at the Game Makers though, when she was being rated after training. They put up a force field in front of that area after that.

I'm glad this thread is back as my wife and I finally saw the movie - we had both read the books awhile ago. Here's the one thing I couldn't figure out: When she's following the trail of blood to find Peeta, how is she supposed to know that it was his? In the book, you know he's been stabbed, but in the movie I don't think they ever show you that.Otherwise, I thought it was very well done. They did a good job of foreshadowing some of the book 2 action that you don't get to see in the first book because it's all from the Katniss perspective.

They did a good job of foreshadowing some of the book 2 action that you don't get to see in the first book because it's all from the Katniss perspective.In the book, she basically just stumbles upon him almost out of sheer chance as he camo'ed himself up with mud. My guess is that they skipped this part because he'd be too dirty to be a good love interest. Blindly following the blood trail was a little naive of Katniss, though.Also...all 3 books follow the 1st person perspective. There's some big advantages to doing so in a book (emotional connection to narrator, visceral descriptions influenced by personal experiences/biases, etc), but doing so in a movie tends not to work as well simply because your main character isn't narrating their every thought and emotion. Also let us see the excellent exchange between President Snow and the Head Gamemaker.I suspect this will help when they make the next 2 movies...

In the book, she at least knew it was likely that he was injured (she heard the others talking about it if I remember correctly.)My wife and I both thought that it was well setup for a possible extended edition as well.

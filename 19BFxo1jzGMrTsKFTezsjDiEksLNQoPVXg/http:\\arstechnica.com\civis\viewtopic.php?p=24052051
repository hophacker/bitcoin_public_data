Validate it forms a self consistent result for the entire day. This validation involves running the system that will eventually consume it against it enabling several very aggressive sanity checks over and above what it would normally do. This isn't just counting things. Like I said, we catch bugs in the *exchange* doing this.

Clearly I should have explained myself better initially. Data corruption is a real physical thing, that will happen with your raw data no matter what. Physics, unfortunately, demands it.Yes, in some processes, you can do checking after the fact to detect and/or correct some errors, possibly all errors. However, this is not always the case. Despite all of that, it doesn't change that you should treat the raw data as the most important thing, even though it may be (will be) imperfect and incorret.

Is it me or is Python quirky? To me, it's much better if months are 0-based; modular arithmetic is easier and jives better with 0-based arrays... Why would they be 1-based? I know display of months is 1-based, but it's better to handle that in the display layer instead of having that permeate the internals and make them more complex. I know Java months are 0-based... so are everyone else's, right?

I thought the point of the datetime module was so you didn't need to do stuff like modular arithmetic on months. I can see the argument for 0 based (and presumably the same with days?), but there's a clear trade-off between that and having an intuitive interface.It is a bit weird that timedelta doesn't support dates (or that there's no datadelta equivalent), so I guess it can't do what you want. I did just find dateutil which allows such things but that's a 3rd-party dependency.

You shouldn't have to care; it should be handled by the type system. In particular, you are mixing dates & offsets. Psuedocode:Code:class Date (int year, uint8 month, uint8 day)class DateOffset (int year, uint8 month, uint8 day)def operator+ (Date d, DateOffset o) := Date(...)def operator+ (Date d, DateOffset o) := DateOffset(...)def operator+ (Date d1, Date d2) := # UNDEFINED!...class Year(y) := Date(y, 1, 1) # or Date(y, 0, 0) -- you shouldn't have to care, so long as operators and properties behave sanelyclass YearOffset(y) := DateOffset(y, 0, 0)class Month(m) := # UNDEFINED!class MonthOffset(m) := DateOffset(0, m, 0) # again, could be 1-based, but that's an impl detail...def month_range(start_year, start_month, num_months) := ...start_year obviously is-a Date; num_months obviously is-a DateOffset; what is start_month? You gave it a name that suggests it's highly similar to start_year, yet it's a fundamentally different type of data. Thus a bug was born.If this were a code review, rather than fix the bug, I'd tell you to genericize the 1st param and remove the 2nd entirely. So a callsite might beCode:for m in month_range(approval.year + initial_month_offset, loan_duration)# instead offor m in month_range(approval.year, initial_month_offset, loan_duration)...which is probably clearer anyway.

While Richard Berg was writing something useful I was screwing around with itertools. Spoiler: show
Code:import datetimefrom itertools import chain, count, imap, islice, repeatdef month_range(start_year, start_month, num_months, step): return islice(imap(datetime.date, chain.from_iterable(imap(repeat, count(start_year), repeat(12))), cycle(range(1,13)), repeat(1)), start_month - 1, start_month + num_months - 1, step)
And I still ended up with an off-by-one bug...

So you end up stuck rolling your own, which is... complicated, to say the least.Fortunately, month-based date operations are (IME) relatively rare-- most financial and business processes tend to operate on a daily or weekly basis. Not that those aren't fraught with perils, too (see the ISO week 0 issue that caused problems with scheduling in iOS earlier this year).

So here's something weird. I set up Console2 to handle both cmd.exe and Powershell, as per Scott Hanselman's instructions. I already have this set-up at work and it's great. But, here at home, when I open a new Powershell tab:Code:Windows PowerShellCopyright (C) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.File C:\Users\Me\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loadedbecause the execution of scripts is disabled on this system.Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.At line:1 char:2+ . <<<< 'C:\Users\Me\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1' + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeExceptionWhich is odd, because as anyone who's tried to use PS will have had to, I set my execution policy to RemoteSigned ages ago. Indeed, running Powershell either as me (a regular user) or as admin:Code:Get-ExecutionPolicy <ENTER>RemoteSignedSame thing if I start cmd.exe and run Powerhsell from there. But if I start it via Console2.exe, I getCode:Get-ExecutionPolicy <ENTER>RestrictedI've tried (and apparently succeeded) to change the exec policy at both a user and LocalMachine scope. Still no dice. Help?The one clue I do have is that starting powershell normally starts a 64-bit process (C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe) whereas starting it via Console2.exe starts a 32-bit process (C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe). I'm on Win7 Ultimate x64, if it matters.

Yup, that did it. Thanks. So, as I now learn, the registry key ExecutionPolicy is to be found not only under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell, but also HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell. Good to know.

Yeah, don't invent this stuff yourself, date and time is horrible, and the more your know, the more you go EWWWyuckyBLARGH. I wish I could use joda-time on Android but the overhead is just a bit too large to justify, so we're left with java.util.Calendar, android.text.format.Time and custom classes (stuff like get all Week's in a Month). But at least if you configure java.util.Calendar well, I get week numbers, first day of the week, TimeZone/DST calculations right for free, only one thing (getWeekYear) had to be backported/borrowed from Java 7, it's n/a in any previous version.I'm looking forward to the day we can drop support for 2.2/2.3 and go all in with libraries instead of trying to keep the .apk below 2-3MB. I know some apps go "screw that" like G+ with 10MB+ worth of binaries, but they do get punished for that with lots of justified complaints and reviews on the store.

Not offhand, but Joda-Time's not particularly Proguard-able because most of its weight comes from the internal stuff (timezones, etc.) that gets linked in pretty much regardless of what you use. Still isn't too bad though.

+240KB for Joda-time and it's dependency Joda-convert for a dist build. Not bad, I thought it was larger, but Proguard is more efficient than I thought.Date and time calculations takes up a good chunk of the CPU usage in the app according to the profiler, it used to be worse but since we ported most calculations to the Time class that uses native code for normalization it's alright. I'll give Joda-time a try when I've some spare time. If there's no CPU penalty, any new app will definitely use this library exclusively.

Code:create table services ( service_id serial primary key, ...);Now I want a table that relates dependent services, encoding facts such as "service A depends on service B".Code:create table service_dependencies ( xxxxx integer not null references services(service_id), yyyyy integer not null references services(service_id), ...);Which name would you use for the xxxxx and yyyyy columns?

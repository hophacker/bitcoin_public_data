I don't see it. Sure, she's not very nice to Arya, and sure she's completely doe-eyed about being Queen or a big Lady or whatnot. That ends quickly with Ned's head coming off. Ever since that point, she's been fine. She's learning, she's biding her time as best she can. It's not really any different in the show, from what we've seen. That smile on her face once Joffrey and Margarey were engaged? That was great. The snacktime with the Tyrells. How could you not like her at this point? At least be rooting for her?

Official moderation notice.
Hey guys, I don't want to play book vs. series police. But this thread is clearly marked for discussion of events and characters are portrayed in the series to date. While the briefest of mention above of someone's preference for a character's portrayal in the series over their portrayal in the books obviously can't be considered a spoiler, I think it's appropriate to remind everyone that--for the purposes of this particular thread--the books may as well not exist. Please restrict discussion to the events and characters portrayed in the series to date. There's another thread for the combined discussion of both the book and television series.

In actual show discussion...Am I wrong for enjoying watching Margarey more than Danerys? Character seems much more complex and I like her (boobs') ability to play Joffrey like the two-bit harp he is. The actress is definitely capable of more than just "pretty face". I feel like Cersei insults her because Margarey, unlike Sansa, is more than capable of countering Cersei once she gets some experience.

As it stands right now, I think you'd only be broken if you enjoyed watching Margaery more if she was actually making out with Daenerys. Then you'd just be broken.Hey, GRRM, if you're reading this, could you make it so? Pleeeeeeease?

So yeah. That episode was fairly well done. Danerys comes across even haughtier and compels me less...so no surprise there. Nice to really noticeably see Riverrun. North of the Wall got a little setup. Somebody actually likes Theon Greyjoy...surprising. The Tyrion/Bron/Pod development was hilarious. And Jamie/Brienne...well...Jamie's sword fighting days are probably over.Though when the credits rolled, I felt like I was watching a different show...

That is some good trolling, there, Game of Thrones. (The very last scene, warming you up to him and then that, and then that punk version of The Bear And The Maiden Fair.)

1. LOVED the facing-down-the-uncle scene. 2. Nobody could be so stupid as to think that dragon is going to stay there. She gets her warriors, flees for a day, then gives the telepathic summons so the dragon burns his way out, and rejoins her. 3. I have no idea why Arya was facing down burnt-face-guy. 4. Pod is The Man!5. Its amazing that Tyrion figured out the books that quickly. It should have been an arduous journey for him to uncover that stuff. Then again, it was probably required by the plot. 6. Didn't see that coming. You have to hand it to the writers. .Good stuff. I liked this episode. Went quickly, advanced the plot, and a minimum of Danerys.

That Pod scene was all kinds of awesome. I love how they basically dropped everything to go "Tell us of your secret magical power!" Not that it really matters, but that wasn't in the books, and thank you to whomever added it. I'm still chuckling over it.

I feel like Cersei insults her because Margarey, unlike Sansa, is more than capable of countering Cersei once she gets some experience.Both Sansa and Margarey are young women that threaten Cersei. Once one of them marry The Joff (thanks for whoever came up with that), they'll be THE Queen. They'll replace Cersei. Since they are young, beautiful, and of marring age, they garner LOTS of attention. So they make Cersei feel old and displaced, something Cersei isn't going to take lightly. The claws come out. But Margarey isn't some frightened little girl with no friends at court. She wants to play The Game, and seems to play it well this far. She isn't someone Cersei can bully around like Sansa. So indeed, Margarey is much more fun to watch. She can spar with Cersei.CPX wrote: I don't think so, not yet...at least not on her own. The reveal of the Queen of Thornes presence tells me that Margarey's capable but not ready to be by herself.

See Sansa.Danerys is still "finding herself" and her trying to grow into her role. Margarey in contrast knows exactly what she wants and knows how to get it.

Banzai51 wrote:They'll replace Cersei.If anyone hasn't noticed yet, this is Cersei's motivation for everything. She wants to be in charge, but she can't be because she's a woman and not even "in charge" of the king any more. Just look at her interactions with Joffrey; she's still trying to exert control over him because he's "hers", but he's started catching on - thus that very, very icy interaction in episode one. It's kind of fascinating when you pick up on the little subtle things driving characters.That being said, I think Cersei actually kind of took a liking, at least as much as she could, to Sansa because she was pretty moldable at the beginning there. Very young, impressionable, and with these ideas of grandeur that she could have easily turned into Cersei's puppet. Margaery, on the other hand, was only brought into the equation for political gain, and Cersei is not happy that the Tyrells are capable of handling themselves in the game of thrones.

To me, the difference between Sansa and Margarey is explored excellently by this guy.TL,DW: Sansa is about the tales, protocol, and the good parts...a young girl who seemingly gets her ideas about the world from Disney and thus fits the mold of princess. Margarey knows those are only tales told to the naive and "queen" doesn't scare her.

She gets her dragon back, frees those enslaved there and still gets to keep her army. At least that's my read on what I thinking she's going to do.

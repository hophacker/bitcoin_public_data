I suppose it's one of those nostalgic things, I grew up listening to stuff I loved (techno, electronic, house, trance, wtf ever, I loved them all, I'm sure someone will correct me as to the differences, though), and now I'm wondering why these new and not so new artists are putting it in their crap.Don't get me wrong, I actually like some of the songs, usually because I liked the few electronic songs back in the day with female vocals. Never thought I'd say I liked Brittany Spears or Selena Gomez, but technically, I didn't say that, yet.I had given up on it for a while, not hearing anything I liked for years. Now, I've recently re-discovered it, and I like Deadmau5, Skrillex, Flux Pavillion, and all (most of) the similar artists that Pandora says I might like.In other news, get off my lawn! When I was your age I had to make my own mix tapes and CDs.

Because the people writing and/or producing it also grew up listening to 90's electronic music.

Also, what comes around goes around.It's the same reason that people wore bell bottoms a while back and all the kids today have these shaggy ass Justin Bieber haircuts.

Yep, the Chemical Brothers are still making music and they hit their stride in the 90's, same with plenty of other popular artists (guessing that's what he meant by pop, but who knows?). You may be amazed to know that there are still new classical compositions, and that's a bit older than the 90's designmerc

Apparently you just didn't keep up with the fact that electronic music never went away.Yes, EDM never went away but we are seeing a major surge of it in pop/Top 40 radio right now either through collabos (David Guetta most notably) or through straight up radio-friendly tracks (Calvin Harris, Avicii, David Guetta again.)There's also the trend of more general EDM "sensibilities" showing up in more straightforward pop/Top 40 music but it's harder to say if that's due to modern EDM or if we're just seeing people who grew up with new wave, synthpop and techno just now coming into major producer roles.

Is this a complaint? I don't see the problem.....I love when there are cycles of new electro, drum n bass, and techno that makes itself known beyond small cliques on the net. I would love another round of the 80's style hip house to pop up again.

The first time I heard Rihanna's We Found Love I thought it was a retro electronica throwback to the mid-90s.

Depeche Mode has had rock and industrial elements for a long time, but they certainly started as straight-up synth-pop.

This is how art has always worked. The bleeding edge either becomes the mainstream or fades into obscurity. What your seeing is totally standard, it just the first time you've noticed it in action.

To the base of the question, I believe the reason that trance/electronic is becoming more popular as an underlay to mainstream "pop" music might have to do with the fact that clubs have been shifting to more techno music for the better part of a decade. Then DJs come from those clubs to take over the radio waves, and bring their favorites from their setlist with them. When techno started hitting the radio, artists decided they needed to keep up. Ergo, what you have today.I'm not sure how much of that is accurate, but that was how Muse explained how they thought it's gotten more mainstream the last time I heard them in an interview.(Side note, you'd love Muse.)

I suppose they never really go for the mainstream "media hype overload" that seems to work well in the US.Over here they're huge. Anyone even remotely interested in Electronic music knows them. Get your fill on the official channel, and others uploads, on Youtube. They're pretty cool about re-use too, and welcome remixes etc, as long as You put a copyright notice on the vid.The beauty of watching someone hearing a few songs that span the decades for the first time, is the attempts to put them in a sub-Genre. I've yet to see anyone manage that sucessfully.EDITYes, I'm a long-time fan... They introduced me to alternative Electronic music in the early 90's, and are a huge reason I still piddle around with Synths etc. I even have the face from the Music for the Jilted Generation inked on me.So yeah, I'm a little biased, but I tried to keep the posts as neutral as I could.

To people into electronic music I think they are well known, but otherwise people only know them for Smack My Bitch Up, the god damn women haters Quote:Depeche Mode has had rock and industrial elements for a long time, but they certainly started as straight-up synth-pop.I guess so, I just always considered them electronica. Synthpop to me was Pet Shop Boys and anything else that was pretty much exclusive to pop40 stations. I heard DM in plenty of places, they just made pop40 because they were popular, not really pop music, IMO (kind of like when you heard Metallica's Enter Sandman on a pop40 station).

I recently came across my old videotapes of Amp, dutifully recorded during the 2:00am-4:00am timeslot it was stuck in, before the Tivo era. Too bad the tapes have degraded so much. That was a good show.

What's with the fascination with attaching styles/fashions/sounds/music etc to specific time periods. If something is good, it should stick around. What's the fixation with change for the sake of change? Sometimes what you change to isn't actually better than what you are changing from.

I didn't exactly want to spell out every single E/Te/Tr/H/D/WTFBBQsauce artist I liked and felt were in current pop songs.

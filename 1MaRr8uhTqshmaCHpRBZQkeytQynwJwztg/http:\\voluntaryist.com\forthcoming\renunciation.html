</p>
This Declaration, made at New Delhi, India on 19 June 2009, WITNESSETH: <br>
 <br>
To the people of this Earth, my fellow human beings, my brothers and  <br>
sisters, in memory of Black Elk and Chief Joseph, and with special  <br>
respect to the Grandmothers and Elders of all indigenous communities, <br>
 <br>
I, Jeff Knaebel, hereby make this Declaration of Severance and  <br>
Dissolution of all bonds between myself and the Government of the  <br>
United States of America. I renounce my birth certificate - I renounce  <br>
my citizenship - and reject all claims of whatsoever nature made by  <br>
the United States against me. I am not government property, and I am  <br>
not a criminal. I am a peace-loving human being who is finished with  <br>
being a slave to the Corporate Warfare State. I am not a citizen of  <br>
any Government. I renounce all of them. <br>
 <br>
I hereby destroy my United States passport by which the United States  <br>
government claims control of my movement upon this earth, and thus  <br>
lays claim upon my right to exist. I will place the shredded remains  <br>
of my passport upon the monument of Mahatma Gandhi. I have chosen this  <br>
monument because it is a symbol that all mankind can recognize: of  <br>
nonviolent resistance to immoral, corrupt, and violent Governments. <br>
 <br>
By this deliberate act of rebellion and sedition, I hope to free  <br>
myself and alert mankind to the dangers it has created by obeying  <br>
Governments of the world. My refusal to remain a tax-compliant  <br>
accomplice to State murder will be considered treason against the  <br>
United States. The choice is this, or treason against human life  <br>
itself. My life is not about supporting the cold blooded murder of  <br>
women and children. <br>
 <br>
No permission is required to renounce that which I never sought in the  <br>
first place, for which I never entered a contract, and which is  <br>
imposed upon me against my will. Having declared myself not a  <br>
citizen, I am therefore not a citizen. Citizenship is either  <br>
voluntary, or it is forcible slavery. <br>
 <br>
The United States government is incomprehensibly malevolent and  <br>
destructive. It takes our money, our identities, and our lives. It  <br>
gives us back corruption, war, heinous crime, and lies. This  <br>
government has no moral right to exist. It ought to be abolished  <br>
without further human bloodshed. <br>
 <br>
The Nation State is a criminal organization which must be opposed in  <br>
its very concept. It is impossible to reform a system that is built  <br>
upon a foundation of lies and violence -- one whose health and  <br>
continuance depends upon endless war. The system must be altogether  <br>
abolished. It is irredeemably evil. <br>
 <br>
The State represents a terminal disease of human consciousness that
is  <br>
anti-life, anti-ethics, and suicidal for the human species. It is a  <br>
sick addictive co-dependency between its citizens and parasitic lying  <br>
murdering psychopathic politicians. <br>
 <br>
Blind obedience to incompetent, deceitful, violent and morally  <br>
depraved authority is a clear case of mental disease. Eckhart Tolle,  <br>
Gopi Krishna and other morally advanced beings have diagnosed the  <br>
United States government as pathologically criminally insane. <br>
 <br>
All political authority is arbitrary: arbitrary as to the form it  <br>
takes; arbitrary as to the boundaries it establishes; arbitrary as to  <br>
the limits of its jurisdiction; and arbitrary as to the taxation it  <br>
collects. If one refuses to bow, to obey, to pay one&#39;s taxes, to use  <br>
Government travel documents, one will ultimately be placed in jail,
or  <br>
die resisting arrest. <br>
 <br>
Even in its most equitable form, it is impossible for government to  <br>
disassociate itself from evil. The State has been conceived in  <br>
violence and is maintained by lies and violence. Its every act can  <br>
only be criminal. Unless the right to ignore the State is recognized,  <br>
its citizens become tainted accomplices in its deeds. <br>
 <br>
From the most democratic to the most totalitarian form of government  <br>
there is ultimately no difference among the powers they exercise. The  <br>
essence of the State is the threat and use of deadly force against  <br>
those who choose not to comply with its edicts. <br>
 <br>
No Government rightfully owns the territory its monopolizes. It has  <br>
stolen possession of whatever land it lays claims to. Everything it  <br>
has, the State has stolen or plundered. It prevents peaceful people  <br>
from establishing their own voluntary cooperative economic and social  <br>
relationships. The purpose of assigning nationality is to control a  <br>
mass of captive taxpayers in order to maintain the large military  <br>
establishment required to keep a citizenry in a state of fearful  <br>
submission to the Power Structure of money. <br>
 <br>
Why should a system of structurally compulsively violent political  <br>
authority be preferred to a cooperative system in which human beings  <br>
live according to the Natural Law of equal liberty? A coercive  <br>
government has no legitimate authority over me. None. Its only  <br>
authority comes through the barrel of a gun. <br>
 <br>
Is the arbitrary &quot;legal&quot; construct of the Corporate State
more  <br>
precious than life? Is this guns-and-steel lifeless structure more  <br>
precious than living, breathing beings? This killing machine  <br>
fabricated of cunning deceitful words of legally piggily on corporate  <br>
parchment... Are we living beings or abstract symbols to be  <br>
manipulated by the Money Power? What is the &quot;National Interest,&quot;  <br>
other than the transfer of wealth and influence to the power elite?  <br>
What about humanity&#39;s interest? <br>
 <br>
I write against the oblivion of humanity. I act in quest of goodness,  <br>
beauty and truth, that we may yet live. <br>
 <br>
I am not Government property. I bid farewell to the United States  <br>
Government and to the citizenship it has imposed upon me against my  <br>
will. I love life too much to be forced to participate in its murder. <br>
 <br>
The United States government is a stain upon humanity. It is a  <br>
grotesque distortion of human relations and the human conscience. It  <br>
is ugly beyond the power of words to describe. Only its end product  <br>
speaks clearly for what it is and what it does. &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;
death  <br>
raining from the sky. Children&#39;s blood flowing in the streets. Body  <br>
parts strewn across wedding festival grounds. A human genome  <br>
corrupted by depleted uranium and agent orange. Hiroshima. Los  <br>
Alamos Lab. The science of death versus the art of life. Torture.  <br>
Rape. Ecocide. Endless heinous crime. The most terrible Merchant of  <br>
Death in human history. Human species suicidal. <br>
 <br>
If you, people of the world, wish to support Government, then so be  <br>
it. But leave me alone. As a peaceful individual I reject your  <br>
authority imposed by violence. I reject all Government claims of  <br>
legitimacy. You and your Government do not have the right to do the  <br>
things that you do. Foremost among these tax-and-public debt financed  <br>
activities are the waging of war; the conscription of soldiers; and  <br>
the expenditure of citizens bread labor upon armaments which by now  <br>
can destroy our earth many times over. I call for an end to these  <br>
activities. I will not support such activities with my life, my  <br>
money, or my energy. <br>
 <br>
The laws of our natural world, the laws of the Great Spirit, the five  <br>
precepts of the Buddha, are morally and practically superior to  <br>
political laws. You must not kill and I must not kill. We must not  <br>
support killing. We must love our neighbors as we love ourselves. As  <br>
the Hopi have said, &quot;From this one commandment, to respect and
revere  <br>
life, come all the other commandments: to tell the truth, to share  <br>
with others, to life together in mutual support, to take care of our  <br>
children and old people, the sick and strangers, friends and enemies,  <br>
to abstain from intoxicants and adultery, not to cheat, steal, or  <br>
covet.&quot; <br>
 <br>
It is up to the individual to discern his duty to his fellowmen and
to  <br>
act accordingly. No other can know my moral conscience, let alone  <br>
&quot;represent&quot; it in decisions of war and peace. How can another  <br>
&quot;represent&quot; me in voting to murder children? The first duty
of love  <br>
is to do no harm. Therefore my duty of love is to renounce the State,  <br>
to withdraw from it, to quit it, to abandon it, to refuse to pay its  <br>
taxes, to refuse participation in its charade of corporate money  <br>
controlled elections, and to live my own life in search of truth and  <br>
righteousness. <br>
 <br>
What do you do when you awaken to the awfulness of the lies of the  <br>
State and the State of the lie? How does one negotiate with  <br>
pathological liars? How does one come to peace with his tax payment  <br>
hiring of cold blooded murder for oil and money? <br>
 <br>
Against whom, then, shall I commit treason? The brotherhood of man?  <br>
My rational mind and common sense? My moral conscience? Or the  <br>
United States government? I prefer treason against the arbitrarily  <br>
imposed rule of an organized crime syndicate to treason against  <br>
humanity. To suffer in tax compliant silence the heinous crimes  <br>
against humanity perpetrated by the United States would be to negate  <br>
whatever is within me that can be called human. <br>
 <br>
The shredding of my government permission-to-exist documents is  <br>
offered as a prayer that the government of the United States --  <br>
perceived to be a criminal organization of incomprehensible scope --  <br>
may be without bloodshed dissolved and abolished from this earth  <br>
forever. <br>
 <br>
I no longer have a Government name; I have no country, no travel  <br>
papers, no passport, and no Government identification. Under the law  <br>
of every Government, I am an illegal human being. Against this  <br>
arbitrary &quot;illegality&quot; I claim my right to exist as a free
and  <br>
sovereign individual. <br>
 <br>
What man -- or group of men -- can declare another to be &quot;illegal?&quot;  <br>
Such men, who cannot give life, would yet take it, as lying murderers  <br>
in God&#39;s own temple. For Power, there is no tomorrow. There are no  <br>
grandchildren. Of the good earth, there is none. There is only  <br>
Power. Persons who aspire to this are degraded, deranged, diseased.  <br>
We are insane to submit to rule by the depraved. <br>
 <br>
What shall be done with me? <br>
 <br>
If deported to the United States, the Government will subject me to  <br>
draconian penalties. Having destroyed my passport, having renounced
my  <br>
citizenship, having made this Declaration, I have become a seditious  <br>
rebel to the United States Government. The United States will have no  <br>
choice but to harass, persecute, and ultimately jail me for speaking  <br>
truth to power. <br>
 <br>
On the one hand, the natural wish to live, to grow, to move about, to  <br>
be free, to act as a man. On the other hand, in order to live in this  <br>
manner with the ordinary amenities of livelihood, I am forced by  <br>
taxation to finance the murder of children who have a sacred right to  <br>
life -- innocent small children who cannot conceive of the wish to  <br>
harm me. <br>
 <br>
There comes a time when the abuses are so great, the mindless  <br>
destruction so wanton, the suffering so stupidly unnecessary, that one  <br>
must resist the Power of rulership with his life. I love Life too  <br>
much to participate in its murder. <br>
 <br>
I bid you farewell, those who would remain in voluntary bondage. Go  <br>
about your life peacefully, respecting yourself, all others, and the  <br>
earth upon which we live. Remember that means is to end as seed is to  <br>
tree. A violent means can never produce a good end. The truth shall  <br>
set us free. My efforts shall not have been in vain. Right always  <br>
overcomes might, even though I may not live to see the day. <br>
 <br>
Whatever happens to me, may you remember my message: Awaken from your  <br>
slumber. Realize that Government depends upon your consent. You  <br>
control yourself. You can withdraw your consent. <br>
 <br>
We must recover Respect -- for life, and for each other.  <br>
Civilizations that get off the Path of Respect do not last, because  <br>
when a people get off the path, they also remove themselves from the  <br>
circle of life. <br>
 <br>
My prayer is to love and to serve. From my heart I seek to act in a  <br>
good way, in a sacred way, for the benefit of many, in support of  <br>
life, that the seventh generation of children may yet live and be happy. <br>
 <br>
The &quot;why&quot; of what I do is put completely to rest by the statement,
&quot;I  <br>
love.&quot; The final answer to any question about my actions is &quot;I  <br>
love.&quot; What is the value of human life -- this is the real question. <br>
 <br>

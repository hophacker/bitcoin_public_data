<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By Carl Watner</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Imagine
that you were the leader of a revolutionary government that had recently
and successfully wrested power from its parent country. Imagine that
some of your citizens refused to obey the laws that you and your legislature
had promulgated. What would you do? Would you ignore their disobedience;
or would you send the police and army after them? How would you assert
your authority, and maintain the power and legitimacy of your government?</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Such
a situation faced President George Washington and Secretary of the Treasury
Alexander Hamilton after Congress passed a federal revenue law on March
3, 1791. [1] How they responded to this and other early threats to their
power illustrates that even newly-founded and limited governments, so-called,
share the same predicament as established States. They must collect
their revenues regardless of the cost. If they fail to suppress disobedience,
they will only be faced with more disobedience, with the end result
being an ultimate challenge to their existence. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Over
the years, I have published articles describing the western Pennsylvania
Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. My purpose in those articles has generally
been to demonstrate that our early American government has always had,
and always exercised, its sovereign power to tax and seize the property
or body of anyone refusing to pay their taxes. [2] What recently renewed
my interest in the topic was reading an article on civil disobedience
in the Kentucky territory during the same era. [3] As it turns out,
resistance to payment of the federal excise tax on whiskey was widespread
in all American frontier areas, from northern New York to southern Georgia.
Furthermore, as Mary Tachau, author of this study, observes; until recently
&quot;this remarkable story of tax evasion&quot;  has experienced
a near historical blackout and cover-up. [4]</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Resistance
to the excise was part and parcel of the frontiersman&#39;s British heritage
and tradition. The inhabitants of the British Isles, especially Irishmen,
had distilled their own whiskey for centuries. When a levy on spirits
in Ireland was introduced in 1661, &quot;it was totally ignored.&quot;
[5] Englishmen, too, developed a &quot;hearty dislike&quot; for excise
taxes. [6]  In the era before modern science, whiskey was valued
not only for its intoxicating effects, but for its use as an anesthetic,
antiseptic, and common everyday medicine. To the frontier farmer, distilling
was not only a natural birthright, but a condition necessary to his
economic survival. It was practically the only way to convert his grain
into ready money, by transporting it over the mountains to where there
was a cash market for his brew.  As far as the American frontiersman
was concerned, his whiskey and freedom hung together. [7] He owned the
seed grain, he owned the land, he labored to harvest the crop, and he
used his own equipment to distill the brew. Whose property had he violated;
whom had he hurt; and was there any identifiable party to whom he owed
money for the right to do as he pleased? &quot;To convert [his] grain
into spirits was considered to be as [much] a natural right as to convert
grain into flour&quot; for his bread. Why should he be subject to a
duty for drinking his grain, rather than eating it? [8] </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Throughout
much of the 18th Century, vast stretches of the American frontier &quot;were
left without the slightest&quot; trace of government authority. [9]
To the American frontiersman, London might as well have been in another
universe, and the new capitol of the United States, Philadelphia, on
another continent. Central government could be safely ignored. Other
than attempting to deliver the mail, it had practically no presence
on the frontier. It offered little protection from the Indians. In 1791,
while Kentucky was still officially part of Virginia, &quot;it was difficult
to organize a tax collection system&quot; because tax collectors resigned
just about as fast as new ones could be appointed. [10] Most Kentuckians
viewed the excise law as so odious that between 1792 and 1796, no lawyer
could be found to represent the federal government and prosecute those
who failed to pay their whiskey excise. [11] Even the governor of the
state refused to pay. [12] </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
frontier regions west of the Allegheny mountains had a long history
of ignoring governmental authority. During the 1760s, Governor John
Penn of Pennsylvania had referred to his western citizens as a &quot;lawless
ungovernable crew.&quot; [13] After the start of the American Revolution,
David Rittenhouse, treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, stated
that &quot;adversaries of the Pennsylvania government were loath to
pay taxes.&quot; He predicted that the likely consequence of non-payment
would be &quot;the early demise of the state.&quot; [14] Other frontier
areas had their own backlash against state and colonial government.
In the early 1770s, North Carolina regulators attacked their local courts,
and the same thing had occurred in western Massachusetts during Shay&#39;s
Rebellion of 1786-1787. There, the local state authorities had suppressed
the disorder. The case of western Pennsylvania was only different in
the sense that it was in closer geographic proximity to federal officials
in Philadelphia, and thus a direct and &quot;embarrassing challenge
to [their] authority.&quot; [15] Hamilton and Washington chose to crush
resistance to the federal excise in western Pennsylvania, not only because
it was closer to them, but because it would be less expensive than sending
troops to North or South Carolina, or Kentucky. As Hamilton observed,

&quot;Crush resistance at the most vulnerable point and the more remote
regions will fall into line.&quot; [16]</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   Unlike the situation
in Kentucky, there were politicians in western Pennsylvania who were
willing to serve the federal government and collect the excise. Pennsylvania
Congressman William Findley explained this distinction to Governor Mifflin
of Pennsylvania in 1792. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;&#39;It is well known,&#39; Findley
reported, &#39;that in some counties, as well of Virginia as of Pennsylvania,
men have not, and cannot be induced by any consideration to accept of
the excise offices. In those counties there have been no riots nor threatening
resolutions; but this arises from the perfect unanimity which subsists
in the dislike to the law&#39;.&quot;  [17]  However in western
Pennsylvania, the Treasury repeatedly pressed the issue of collection
and found John Neville, a well-known state official to represent the
federal government. Neville was wealthy by local standards and had originally
opposed the federal excise tax when he &quot;was a member of the Pennsylvania
assembly when that body adopted a resolution condemning the tax in 1791.&quot;
When he later was appointed to the office of excise inspector, his neighbors
thought that he &quot;was giving up his principles for a bribe and bartering
the confidence they had in him for&quot; a federal salary. &quot;He
became a catalyst for mounting opposition to the law.&quot; [18]</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Although
all the key political players in the decision to snuff out the Whiskey
rebellion were Federalists and supporters of a strong central American
government, there were some differences among them as to how government
force was to be used. The general Federalist outlook was that any opposition
to the whiskey excise was a challenge &quot;to the very roots of authority
and order.&quot; [19] Federalists believed that every good government
&quot;must provide for its own security and preservation,&quot; [20]
and they saw &quot;a permanent standing army&quot; as a way &quot;to
coerce the people and silence them into obedience to authority.&quot;
[21] President Washington took opposition to the nation&#39;s law as a personal
affront to himself. &quot;He felt that the excise was a just law,&quot;

and he viewed any opposition to it as &quot;equivalent to advocating
separation from the union, &#39;the most dreadful of all calamities&#39;.&quot;
[22] Washington certainly &quot;exemplified the Federalist belief that
a display of force was necessary&quot; not only to subdue the rebels,
but to show the world that his government was committed to a lasting
union&quot; of the states. [23]</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     In
early September 1792, Alexander Hamilton urged President Washington
to issue a public proclamation taking a strong stand on the patriotic
necessity of paying the excise. As Edmund Randolph, the United States
Attorney General  (1789-1794), pointed out, the enforcement of
the excise law was &quot;a delicate problem with potentially wide-ranging
ramifications.&quot; [24] The federal government had no soldiers of
its own. It had to rely on state militiamen to enforce its laws. Governor
Mifflin of Pennsylvania, a Republican, hesitated to commit his state&#39;s
militia, &quot;and he argued heatedly that out of hatred for the excise,
unwillingness to march on fellow citizens, or desire to avoid a long
expedition, large numbers of [his] militia might ignore his orders.&quot;

[25] Instead of sending an army after the resisters, Randolph advocated
the use of the civil courts by indicting the tax evaders and trying
them in the regular courts. Only if that failed, would he consent to
calling out the militia to enforce the law. [26] In contrast to Hamilton,
Randolph argued &quot;The strength of a government is the affection
of [its] people,&quot; not their fear of its army. [27]</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     President
Washington took the position that military force was only to be used
as a last resort. His Anti-federalist opponents had adopted the Whig
opposition to standing armies.  &quot;[O]therwise there would be
a cry at once, &#39;The cat is let out; we now see for what purpose an army
was raised&#39;.&quot; Washington feared that the use of  troops to
enforce the law would shift the public argument from the question of
<a href='/howibecame/eyre.html'>law enforcement</a> to the question of standing armies. [28] In its final
version, the presidential proclamation of September 15, 1792 was issued
as a public broadside and published in the leading newspapers. &quot;It
decried all actions &#39;tending to obstruct the operation of the laws of
the United States for raising a revenue upon [distilled] spirits ...
subversive of good order, contrary to the duty that every citizen owes
his country and to the laws, and of a nature dangerous to the very being
of government&#39;.&quot; Washington warned all opponents of the government
and its excise that they &quot;would be dealt with harshly.&quot; [29]</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Of
all the participants in the discussions about how to enforce the law,
Alexander Hamilton was, from the beginning, the most militant. He had
originally conceived the idea of the whiskey tax as part of his plan
to fund the revolutionary war debt, and as early as July 1792, he had
advocated proceeding against the non-payers in western North Carolina.
He was dissuaded from this idea by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
John Jay, who warned that nothing could be worse for the new federal
government than a military humiliation at the hands of tax rebels. &quot;No
strong declarations should be made unless there be ability and disposition
to follow them with strong measures.&quot; [30] Nevertheless, Hamilton
feared that &quot;if forceful action was not taken &#39;the spirit of disobedience
... [would] naturally extend and the authority of the government will
be prostrate&#39;.&quot; [31] </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     During
the two years following the issuance of the federal proclamation little
progress was made in satisfying the concerns of the excise resisters.
In February 1794, President Washington received, what he perceived to
be a treasonous petition of grievances against the national government
sent by the members of the Mingo Creek Society in Washington County,
Pennsylvania. [32] They sought free navigation of the Mississippi River,
government protection from the Indians, and relief from the excise.
The following month, John Neville, their regional supervisor for the
collection of the  excise, was accosted. In July, his house was
surrounded and fired upon by a crowd of fifty men. The next day it was
torched by a mob of over 400. Several men were killed, but Neville escaped.
When this news reached President Washington and Secretary of the Treasury
Hamilton in Philadelphia, they conferred with other officials. At a
conference on August 2, 1794, Hamilton told the representatives of the
Pennsylvania state government that the moment of  crisis had arrived.
[33] &quot;The immediate question,&quot; he concluded, was &quot;whether
the government of the Untied States shall ever raise revenue by any
internal tax.&quot; [34] Hamilton advocated raising a national militia
of 12,000 men and marching them to western Pennsylvania to put down
the rebellion. As Hamilton put it, &quot;Government can never be said
to be established until some signal display has manifested its power
of military coercion.&quot; [35] President Washington was of a like
mind, accepting &quot;Hamilton&#39;s premises about the necessity for strict
enforcement lest the laws and government itself be undermined, but he
was [also] cognizant that force would not only need public support
but would also have political overtones beyond the simple enforcement
of the law.&quot; [36] As a result of this conference Supreme Court
Justice James Wilson certified on August 4, 1794 that a state of rebellion
existed in western Pennsylvania.  Washington put out the call for
12,950 militia men from the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and Virginia. [37] As Governor Mifflin had predicted, &quot;[d]raft
resistance was common,&quot; [38] and even after being enrolled, the
desertion rate was high. [39]</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     By
the time the national army arrived near Pittsburgh, whatever rebellion
may have existed had practically disappeared. &quot;[P]erhaps as many
as 2000 &#39;rebels&#39; had fled deeper into the wilderness before the army
arrived.&quot; [40] An amnesty was declared for those who would swear
their loyalty to the government. Ultimately, about 150 suspects were
rounded up and about 20 were transported back to Philadelphia for trial.
Two were ultimately convicted, and then later pardoned. [41] Washington
&quot;believed &#39;this event having happened at the time it did, was fortunate&#39;.
The troops had &#39;terrified the insurgents,&#39; and the government had taught
its enemies within and without the nation about the spirit and power
that bolstered the Union.&quot; [42] It was Hamilton who first coined
the term &quot;whiskey insurrection.&quot; In a December 1794 letter
he wrote, &quot;Our insurrection is most happily terminated. Government
has gained from it reputation and strength.&quot; In an earlier letter
of late October 1794 he had written that &quot;the insurrection will
do us a great deal of good and add to the solidity of everything in
this country.&quot; [43] If Hamilton learned any lesson from the Whiskey
rebellion it was that it was best for the government to never employ
an inadequate force in subduing its opponents. &quot;&#39;Tis far better
to err on the other side. Whenever the government appears in arms, it
ought to appear like Hercules and inspire respect by display of strength.&quot;

[44] In retrospect, this was certainly the case. &quot;President Washington
raised more troops to put down the Whiskey Rebellion than were ever
used to fight the Indians on the frontier and more than any force he
had commanded in the American Revolution.&quot; [45]</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
main purpose of raising and marching an army to western Pennsylvania
was to demonstrate that the federal government was a permanent and secure
fixture in the American political environment. It was successful in
the sense that it showed the federal government could flex its military
muscle hundreds of miles distant from its center of power, but it failed
to insure the collection of the excise tax, for in fact, nonpayment
of the tax continued for years after the insurrection was suppressed.
[46].   This exercise of national power at the time of the
Whiskey Rebellion represents a number of &quot;firsts.&quot; It &quot;marked
the first time that the federal government used military force to exert
its authority [directly] over the nation&#39;s citizens.&quot; [47] It was
also the first time that a sitting president personally commanded the
military in the field. The Whiskey Rebellion also marked the first time
anyone in the United States was arrested and tried for treason in the
federal courts. &quot;These trials established the precedent that armed
opposition to the execution of a United States statute was equal to
&#39;levying war&#39; against the United States and thus was within the constitutional
definition of treason.&quot; [48]</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
Whiskey Rebellion also clearly demonstrated the nature of limited, constitutional
government. As Albert Jay Nock  and Walter Lippmann pointed out,
the American revolutionaries wanted to separate themselves from the
British empire so they could assume the powers hitherto exercised by
the English Parliament. The evidence is clear: the heroes of the American
revolution and the Founding Fathers opposed the Stamp Act when they
were out of power, but supported the whiskey tax when they were in power.
Even most frontiersmen and whiskey rebels weren&#39;t against taxes, per
se. [49] They had a long history of willingly paying direct land taxes,
and simply wanted to lessen their own tax burden by shifting it to the
merchants and &quot;large-scale speculator[s] in western lands&quot;.
[50] The Federal Constitution gave Congress &quot;the unlimited &#39;power
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises&#39;. ... The taxing
authority of the ... national government ... was no less, and was certainly
designed to be even greater, than anything attempted by the British
government during the 1760s and 1770s.&quot; [51] During the debates
over the Constitution, critics pointed out that &quot;the collection
of taxes would be enforced ... by [a] standing army.&quot; &quot;William
Goudy of North Carolina feared that the taxation clause of the proposed
Constitution &#39;will totally destroy our liberties&#39;.&quot; [52] Thus,
it was with some justice that the Scottish poet, Robert Burns, wrote
that freedom and whiskey hang together. Taxation is the linchpin of
every government. Without the revenue provided by taxation a government
could not recruit, field, and pay its soldiers; without soldiers a government
could not enforce its laws. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
problem of governance under the new constitution was certainly a many
nuanced one. As the Voluntaryist Statement of Purpose points out, &quot;governments
must cloak their actions in an aura of moral legitimacy in order to
sustain their power,&quot; and the early American politicians certainly
understood, recognized, and acted on this insight. The necessity for
and the widespread use of force by a government is indicative of its
unwilling acceptance by those over whom it rules. &quot;The application
of force tells us that many people&quot; will not willingly comply with
the law. [53] As George Smith observed: the more force, the less legitimacy;
the more voluntary compliance, the less need for force, and the higher
the legitimacy level of a given government. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
lessons of the Whiskey Rebellion for the voluntaryist are numerous.
First, we must recognize the damaging effects that arise from the government&#39;s
initiation of force in the conduct of otherwise benign human affairs.
Secondly, we see that we must delegitimize the State through education;
that violence must not be used to oppose state violence (because the
resort to violence only gives the State an excuse to use its armed forces).
Finally, we must see that the strength of a free citizenry is not in
how many guns it possesses, but in its collective determination to resist.
Opponents of the State must have faith in their fellow human beings
- that they will not let them stand alone against the physical force
of government; that they will stand together and risk individual physical
injury in order to prevent collective injury to their social freedoms.

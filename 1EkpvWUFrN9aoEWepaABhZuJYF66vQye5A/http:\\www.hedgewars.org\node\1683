        <p>Hi <img src="/images/smileys/Smile.png" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>  First to say - damn, I wrote this thing more than half an hour and my stupid' browser crashed, and I had to rewrite it. <img src="/images/smileys/sad.png" title="Sad Smiley" alt="Sad Smiley" /><br />
  Now about the idea.<br />
  <br />
  In the game there are 3 major layers (I devided them so, but I'm sure the devs mean something else <img src="/images/smileys/Smile.png" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />) - background, middle and foreground. I've not included the GUI layer.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight:bold">What's all that with the layers?</span><br />
  BACKGROUND LAYER: includes (now thanks to Tiyuri) hi-res image, rain and water animations.<br />
  MIDDLE: this is the actual playground where there's solid ground, objects to destroy and hedgehogs to play with. Plus some fluffy clouds in the sky.<br />
  FOREGROUND: here's only one thing (as far as I can see) - another water animation.<br />
  You can see this on this image:<br />
  <img src="http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/9760/hwlayersnow.png" alt="" class="bb-image" /><br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight:bold">More depth?</span><br />
  Now my idea is to include another layer between the front and middle one, that is - between the water and the solid ground(where you actually do the killin'):<br />
  <img src="http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6056/hwlayers.png" alt="" class="bb-image" /><br />
  It'll be like in the old school 2D animation (don't now how it works now with all that machines that do the work) or like in a theatre wher you have the same foreground for a couple of scenes and you only want to move the characters around. Of course the position of the objects in the new layer and the old middle layer (the battlefield <img src="/images/smileys/Smile.png" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />) will be different so that they don't overlap and not give you the opportunity to feel the depth of the field. Althoug some of you may think that this is just a stupid eye-candy, I'll prove you wrong: by using teleportation utility or in the future - invisibility, you can hide your hedgehog behind a bush without your opponent noticing that. Then he'll do his thing and on the next turn you'll be given the opportunity to make an "ambush". <img src="/images/smileys/wink.png" title="Wink Smiley" alt="Wink Smiley" /> Example scenario: last minutes of the game. Only a few survivors are left struggling for the glory of winning the battle. Hedgehog A (your team) teleports silently behind a tree, high grass, a rock, a bush or whatever the theme offers as objects. Hedgehog B (from the enemy's team) doesn't know where hedgehog A has teleported. So he wants to strike another hedgehog of your team. He moves slowly near the bush (for example) behind which your guy's hiding, then he aims and fires. The target's hit and your second hedgehog dies in great pain...But not in vain. Because in the next turn your opponent realizes that this move has brought a great defeat. Your hedghog A jumps out the bush and with a swift move of his whip, he strikes down the enemy. <img src="/images/smileys/Smile.png" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /><br />
  In a more grassy terrain you can even make an encircling movement behind a great field of grass and thus reach your enemies unnoticed (some modifications should be made here in order to do that, since in multy there's a big red ****ing point that points directly to your hedgehog <img src="/images/smileys/sad.png" title="Sad Smiley" alt="Sad Smiley" /> )<br />
  So you have a much greater depth of the game fiels which also brings even greater strategical taste (and can be also used for future updates like the balloon that Tiyuri plans to make).<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight:bold">More depth AND realism, please.</span><br />
  In order to make it a little bit more realistic, there should be a surrealistic 3D feel when it comes to explosion. You'll agree that it's very dull if you hide behind a bush, a shell hit's you on the forehead, your body's ripped appart along with a 100-150kg dirt and the bush, behind which you were hiding, doesn't move at all. As if nothing has happened behind it. <img src="/images/smileys/biggrin.png" title="Big Grin" alt="Big Grin" /> So here's the parallelism of the explosions.<br />
  <img src="http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/6747/hwlayersparallelexplosi.png" alt="" class="bb-image" /><br />
  In order to do that, the new layer will also have an exact copy of the solid ground in the middle layer (where your hedgehogs are). When something explodes, the explosion will be transfered onto the new layer in order to affect the objects there too. If you're hiding behind a bush, someone drops a TNT in front of your face and it tears you into tiny peaces of blood, brain and flesh, it will do the same with the bush, behind which you were hiding.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  That's my idea. It's a major modification (at least I think so) but I think it's worth giving a shot.<br />
  <br />
  <br />

        <p>Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Interesting idea, but I think it would take it too far, a bit of a overkill for now:<br />
<img src="/images/smileys/geek.png" title="Geek" alt="Geek" /><br />
#1 you're right, there would several changes needed in order to accomplish that, even beside adding the layer and it's interaction with explosions, e.g. disabling display of hogs/names based on it's visibility, not showing the cursor on teleports etc etc.</p>

<p>#2 physics, mine positions, weapon effects and hog movement would be harder to estimate, so there might be a negative impact on gameplay</p>

<p>#3 the more layers there are, the more visually distracting they are</p>

<p>#4 if of tactical use it couldn't even be disabled in low gfx mode</p>

<p>#5 hiding isn't really a supposed to be a gameplay element afaik - what's next, a mode where you can only see what is in the field of view of your own team's hogs? :P (yeah, I know that sounds awesome lol)</p>

<p>#6 you really have too much spare time on your hand :P</p>

<p>#7 this idea neither feature black-jack nor hookers</p>

<p>#8 "More depth AND realism, please." - visual depth isn't really important for HW, it's supposed to be a 2D game</p>

<p>#9 "More depth AND realism, please." - realism isn't really important for HW, it's supposed to be an fun game, not a simulation</p>

<p>#10 I'm out of things to list and to annoy you with, but maybe I have more tomorrow <img src="/images/smileys/wink.png" title="Wink Smiley" alt="Wink Smiley" /></p>

<p>(I numbered them for easier agreeing/disagreeing/commenting)</p>

<p>That's just my opinion though, I don't know what the significant individual around here think.</p>

<p>Btw: Start coding for HW yourself and you could -maybe- implement this and other things yourself (at least as optional feature) <img src="/images/smileys/Smile.png" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /><br />
Or start coding for Wurmux, I bet they love realism and features (even more than gameplay), they even intend to use a 3D physics engine (bullet), plus they are in C++ I think :PPP<br />
(don't feel insulted now, I appreciate the work you put into the idea, so I would find it cool if you could realize it at least in Wormux if it shouldn't be possible here because of #1-10, other reasons or evil pascal)</p>

<p>Cool/Funny pictures you made there (see #6) <img src="/images/smileys/biggrin.png" title="Big Grin" alt="Big Grin" /></p>

<p>wrt "First to say - damn, I wrote this thing more than half an hour and my stupid' browser crashed, and I had to rewrite it." -- yeah, I hate that when that happens... maybe that's why I always write longer texts into a textfile first and then copy it into the browser when it's finished :P</p>

<p>Have a nice <s>day</s> night!</p>

<p>&quot;George W. Bush, Zionist Double Agent, American Traitor&quot; by Texe Marrs is a very interesting article, and I believe most of it, if not all, is true. </p>
<p>However, I wish to point out that the picture of Bush carrying the <a href="/search/node/talmud">Talmud</a> is an apparent fake. A faked picture can easily discredit the whole article and <a href="/zionism/">subject</a> which would be a shame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://100777.com/images/left_517.jpg" width="358" height="440"/></p>
<p>This appears to be the source of the picture on the net,</p>
<p>Picture of the Day Archive, on the Shmais News Service : <a href="http://www.shmais.com/picofdayall.cfm">http://www.shmais.com/picofdayall.cfm</a> </p>
<p>And this is the picture: <a href="http://www.shmais.com/images/largepics/left_517.jpg">http://www.shmais.com/images/largepics/left_517.jpg</a></p>
<p><br/>
</p><br/><br/><blockquote>
<b>Update</b><br/><br/>
I sent an email to <span class="spamspan"><span class="u">SHMAIS</span> [at] <span class="d">aol [dot] com</span></span> about the picture and received this reply:<br/><br/>
<i>"i AM AWARE IT WAS A "PURIM SPOOF" PICTURE"<br/><br/></i>
</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>I've looked at it before and remembered seeing another variation, an obvious fake, of the picture where he is carrying a book called &quot;Presidency for Dummies&quot;. This picture is mirrored compared to the one where he is carrying the <a href="/search/node/talmud">Talmud</a> so that he is waving with right hand.. </p>
<p><img src="http://100777.com/images/bush.jpg" width="359" height="450"/></p>
<p>Here is a Google Image search for that picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=bush+for+dummies+book&sourceid=mozilla-search&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&sa=N&tab=wi">http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=bush+for+dummies+book&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi</a></p>
<p>Overall the image of Bush carrying the <a href="/search/node/talmud">Talmud</a> just looks fake; the light is somehow not right, the contrasts, perhaps even the proportions - it simply looks like it has been put there. </p>
<p>One detail that looks like a giveaway is if you look at the spine of the book, you see that on the left side it is white, and not thick enough.</p>
<p><img src="http://100777.com/images/bushtalmud.jpg" width="963" height="447"/></p>
<p>I've made an animated GIF picture comparing the two fakes. In my opinion it reveals a lot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <img src="http://100777.com/images/bushtalmudanim.gif" width="228" height="191"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Conclusion; to me it appears as though the very original picture, (that I've not yet been able to track down) Bush was carrying a white ring binder of some sort whereafter someone has edited it to a &quot;Bush for Dummies book&quot;. The picture of Bush carrying the Talmud has been edited either using the original, or the Bush for Dummies version, forgetting to edit a part of the spine of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now for Mr. Marrs' article, hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;"A man is considered an anti-Semite if he &nbsp;calls a Jew a Jew." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Hillaire Belloc, quoted in <em>Culture Wars</em> (Sept 2000) </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;"Then...when the doors were shut where the &nbsp;disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and &nbsp;stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&tilde;John &nbsp;20:19 </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> It was in 1990 that I first met the remarkable and brilliant &nbsp;Boris Lunachev. Aged, bent over slightly by repeated attacks of &nbsp;osteoporosis, Lunachev had asked to see me privately. He had, I &nbsp;understood, once been a most distinguished professor of Marxist &nbsp;doctrine at the prestigious Lenin Institute. He was a rising star on &nbsp;the Soviet political and educational scene. But in the late 70s, &nbsp;Lunachev was abruptly and unceremoniously ousted from his post and &nbsp;exiled to the West. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> Shaking the wisened old man's hand and seeking to inject a &nbsp;friendly tone into our conversation, I smiled and said, "So, you are &nbsp;a Russian, Dr. Lunachev?" </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "Yes, I am a Russian," he answered. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "But please, my dear friend," he continued. "Always remember, &nbsp;there are Russians and then there are Russians. And some who are &nbsp;Russian are not Russian." </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> Confusing language, I thought, if intriguing. I made a mental &nbsp;note to later inquire further into the nature of Lunachev's puzzling &nbsp;words. However, I soon discovered that follow up was not at all &nbsp;necessary. The good Professor Lunachev more than answered my &nbsp;curiosity with what he had to say. </p>
<p align="center"> <br/>
<b>A Stellar Career Until...<br/>
</b> </p>
<p> Lunachev recounted his stellar career, beginning as a leader of &nbsp;the Communist Youth, his earning of high-level doctorate degrees, and his academic career, during which he was lauded and commended on a regular basis. Apparently, Lunachev was poised for further advancement; he was even being considered for a top political position in the Kremlin as a Marxist theoretician and was well rewarded economically by the elite intelligencia. Until...until he said something very, very vital - and very, very sensitive - to the &nbsp;wrong person. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> It seems that a high-ranking Commissar had come from Moscow to the Institute to interview Lunachev for the Kremlin post. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> The Commissar, who was very pleased with Lunachev's deportment and his responses to standard questions, finally stated: "Professor Lunachev, is there any area of research or study that you have conducted that is unique or unusual?" </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "Yes," Lunachev replied. "I have recently been studying the field of race and biology. I have discovered that the great Karl Marx was a Jew and so was Comrade Lenin." "Comrade Stalin was an avid reader of the Jewish Talmud, and Comrade Khruschev's real surname was Perlmutter. He, too, was a Jew." </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "I believe these facts of racial history need to be reported to the Soviet people and to the world," said Lunachev, "so everyone will recognize that the government of the USSR is not, as some have alleged, anti-Semitic." </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "Thank you for your time." retorted the now sober-faced and ashen Commissar. "You are dismissed." </p>
<p align="center"> <br/>
<b>His Unpardonable Crime<br/>
</b> </p>
<p> That very evening, Boris Lunachev was accosted on his way home by Soviet secret police. He was taken promptly to a waiting aircraft and flown to Rome, Italy, where he was told by Soviet Embassy officials he would forever be persona non grata (unwelcome) in his native Russia. He had become an outcast. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> What was Lunachev's horrible crime, his unacceptable transgression against his Communist overseers? </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "My unpardonable crime," Lunachev said to me, "was to call a Jew a Jew." </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> Professor Lunachev, however, considered himself fortunate, indeed. "In 1917 in Soviet Russia," he explained, "one of the first laws passed by Lenin and the Bolsheviks was a law making anti-Semitism a crime punishable by death. In Rome, the KGB bluntly told me that to call a Jew a Jew, and especially to make public the name of a crypto-Jew, one who was hiding under an assumed Russian name, was clearly an act of anti-Semitism." </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> And so it was that Lunachev, by no means an anti-Semite in the real meaning of the term, a man who simply wanted to give Communism's founders and pioneers their due by recognizing their racial ancestry, became a feared and marked outlaw, a dangerous subversive to be banished and persecuted. </p>

&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Understanding Lunachev's Predicament<br/>
</b> </p>
<p> I vaguely understand Lunachev's predicament. I was the first to publish the true facts regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's Jewish ancestry. I also exposed "Irish" Senator John Kerry's true race - yep, &nbsp;he's a crypto-Jew. And for good measure, I threw in revelations that &nbsp;former Secretary of State, Comrade Madeleine Albright, and General Wesley Clark are also Jews. Reluctantly and angrily, Hillary, Kerry, &nbsp;Clark and Albright subsequently came out of the closet and owned up to their Jewish heritage, though they have all refused to explain why they had hidden it all these many years. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> What a buzzsaw and furor I had ignited! The hounds out of Jerusalem's darkest cemeteries came at me with fangs bared, blood dripping from the corners of their gaping jaws. I discovered, as did Lunachev, that it is forbidden to call a Jew a Jew. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> That was when I, too, realized, that I had unwittingly become a vile and evil "anti-Semite," targeted for destruction by the denizens of the emerging Jewish World State. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> However, unlike in Soviet Russia, in America the midnight cowboys who reside in the cesspool of Soviet Washington, D.C. have so far been unable to banish Texe Marrs or to oust me from my independent perch as president of <i>Power of Prophecy Ministries</i>. Oh, how they have tried, but I am still here, toiling away, exercising my First Amendment rights, much to their chagrin and annoyance. </p>

<b>And Now, Yet Another Revelation<br/>
</b> </p>
<p> And now, dear friends, I have decided to reveal to you the name &nbsp;of yet another crypto-Jew. This time, the culprit is a man who is only the latest in a series of dynastic leaders, all of whom were and are Jews and all of whom have carefully and watchfully guarded this Great Secret. I hereby stamp myself - according to the reigning criteria or rules promulgated by the Illuminati elite - as a bonafide anti-Semite merely by once again calling a Jew a Jew. Fact: GEORGE &nbsp;W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, is a Jew. <br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm">http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm</a> </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> Absurd? Preposterous, you say? Well, I have carefully traced the &nbsp;history of the Bush Dynasty, including the Rothschild faction, and without hesitation I declare to you that, yes, indeed, George W. &nbsp;Bush is a Jew: A Jew by race, a Jew by religious choice. Hidden from public view. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> What the media dare not tell you is that, as President, George W. Bush appointed as his first official White House spokesman, a Jew - in &nbsp;fact, a Jewish rabbi - Ari Fleischer. He retained a Jewish banker, &nbsp;Alan Greenspan, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He made a Jewish &nbsp;Rabbi, Dov Zackheim, the Comptroller (money man!) of the Pentagon, and he placed a Jewish ideologue and Christian hater, Michael Chertoff, in the scary position of being head of FEMA and Homeland Security. Yes, Chertoff, an ADL fiend whose father is a Jewish rabbi, is now America's Gulag Commandant, our American version of Himmler. <br/>

<p> My investigation of the Bush-Jewish connection has been in progress for six years now. One thing I discovered is that George W. Bush is a devoted student of the Jewish Talmud, just as were Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin. He is also, I am persuaded, a dedicated agent of Zionist Israel, which makes him double agent and traitor to the United States of America. <br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/freedman.htm">http://jahtruth.net/freedman.htm</a> </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> Bush has adopted the same techniques of torture, political deceit, perpetual war, and pure hatred of perceived enemies, as has the notorious Israeli spy agency, Mossad. The Mossad's motto is "By Way of Deception Make War." This, not coincidentally, is also George W. Bush's motto. How very Talmudic. How very Satanic. </p>
<p align="center"> <br/>
<b>"Christians Who Are Not Christians"<br/>
</b> </p>
<p> But, isn't Bush supposed to be a Christian? How, then can he be a religious Jew? Ah, perhaps those who ask this question should read books like Colonel Donn de Grand Pr&eacute;'s insightful Barbarians Inside the Gates: Book Three, the Rattler's Revenge. As my friend, the good &nbsp;Colonel de Grand Pr&eacute;, notes so wisely in his excellently documented volume, we are confronted today by Leviathan, a two-headed monster, &nbsp;"one head comprised of Jews who are not Jews and the other, Christians who are not Christians." <br/>

<p> Which leads me back to Professor Boris Lunachev and our informative and rewarding meeting. As we departed, I again took his hand in mine and I asked him. "Dr. Lunachev, is there anything you'd like to say to me, perhaps to capitalize or to emphasize the importance of what we have discussed?" </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p> "Yes," Lunachev answered, his probing brown eyes peering deep into mine. "I beg you to never forget, there are Americans and then there are Americans. And some who are American are not American." </p>

<p>You wrote, that the money connection of Rothschild agent, Haym Salomon is revealed in the publication of the National Jewish Welfare Board. Can you tell on which page the quote is to find and what exactly is written there?<br/>
It would be very nice of you if you help me. I have a great deal of trouble to find that book here in Germany. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Who is the idiot that did an analysis on the two George Bush photos?</p>
<p>Hey brainiac, the Presidency for Dummies was done the first week of Bush's reign. I created it from an AP image that was released the day I photoshoped it.</p>
<p>The other Artscroll is a horrible fake! Some hack flopped my image and slapped a crude version of their book over it. at least the genius of mine was, there was no Presidency for Dummies before I created it.The perspective is off, W has a wedding ring on his right hand, come on, pick it up or leave it alone.</p>

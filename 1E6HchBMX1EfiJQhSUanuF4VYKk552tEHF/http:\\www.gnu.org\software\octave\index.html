    GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
    for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the numerical
    solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing
    other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive graphics
    capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  Octave is
    normally used through its interactive command line interface, but
    it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.  The Octave
    language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily
    portable.

  <h2>March 7, 2014 &mdash; Octave 3.8.1 Released</h2>
  <p>
    Version 3.8.1 is a bug fixing release and is now available for
    <a href="download.html">download</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest new features for the Octave 3.8.x release
    series is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that
    users have requested most often over the last few years and now it
    is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we
    would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series
    before making the GUI the default interface (until then, you can use
    the <tt>--force-gui</tt> option to start the GUI).
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and
    improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided
    against delaying the release any longer.  So please enjoy the 3.8
    release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it
    is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some
    obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>We need your help</strong>.  There are many ways that you
    can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and
    improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts
    alike:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by
        contributing your time to
        <a href="http://octave.org/get-involved.html">help with
          Octave's development</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged
        to <a href="http://octave.org/bugs.html">report the problems
        you find</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether you are a user or developer, you can help to fund the
        project.  Octave development takes a lot of time and
        expertise.
        Your <a href="http://octave.org/donate.html">contributions
        help Octave continue to improve</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even
    better for the future!
  <p>

    list of user-visible changes.

  <h2>February 26, 2013 &mdash; Google Summer of Code</h2>
  <p>
    Octave was selected as a <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/octave">mentoring organization</a> for the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">Google Summer of Code</a> program for 2014.
    We have participated in the past as part of the
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Project</a> but this is the first
    year that we have been a mentoring organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interested students who meet the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page">requirements</a> listed on the GSoC web
    site are encouraged to apply (see the Students and
    Eligibility section).  Please also note the <a href="http://wiki.octave.org/GSoC_Project_Ideas#Steps_Toward_a_Successful_Application">guidelines for Octave</a>.

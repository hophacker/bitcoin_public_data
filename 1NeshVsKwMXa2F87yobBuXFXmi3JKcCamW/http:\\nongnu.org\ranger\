<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  ranger is a file manager with VI key bindings.  It provides a minimalistic and
  nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.  The secondary
  task of ranger is to psychically guess which program you want to use for
  opening particular files.
</p>

  <li>Uses <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (2.6 or higher)</li>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (tested with version 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) with support for ncurses and (optionally) wide-unicode.</li>
<li>A pager (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/less/">less</a> by default)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Optional:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.darwinsys.com/file/">file</a> for determining file types</li>
<li>The python module <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet">chardet</a>, in case of encoding detection problems</li>
<li>"sudo" to use the "run as root"-feature</li>
<li><a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> for <a href="screenshots/w3mimgpreview.png">previewing images in "true color"</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Optional, for enhanced file previews (with "scope.sh"):
</p>
<ul>
<li>img2txt (from <a href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca">caca-utils</a>) for previewing images in <a href="screenshots/ranger-screenshot_large-image-preview.png">ASCII-art</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.html">highlight</a> for syntax highlighting of code</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/atool/">atool</a> for previews of archives</li>
<li><a href="http://lynx.browser.org">lynx</a>, <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> or <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a> for previews of html pages</li>
<li>pdftotext for pdf previews</li>
<li><a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">transmission-show</a> for viewing bit-torrent information</li>
<li><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en">mediainfo</a> or exiftool for viewing information about media files</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: <a href="screenshots/w3mimgpreview.png">previewing images in "true color"</a> is disabled by default.  To enable it, first make sure you have w3m installed, then check that your terminal supports it.  It was successfully tested with <b>urxvt</b> and <b>xterm</b>, while it did not work with <b>gnome-terminal</b> and <b>st</b>.  Currently it does not work with <b>tmux</b> but with <b>screen</b>.  Finally, add this line to your ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and restart ranger:
</p>

<div class="code">set preview_images true</div>

<p>
  Note: to use custom file previews, you need ranger 1.3.1 or later, and a script that creates previews. Use the default script by typing:
</p>

<div class='code'>ranger --copy-config=scope</div>

<p> <hr /> </p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>UTF-8 Support</li>
<li>Multi-column display</li>
<li>Preview of the selected file/directory</li>
<li>Common file operations (create/chmod/copy/delete/...)</li>
<li>VIM-like console and hotkeys</li>

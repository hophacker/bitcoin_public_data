											<p>So it&#8217;s only fifty five days until the <strong>WSOP</strong> and I&#8217;m getting excited just thinking about it.  Last year I went in quite rusty not having really played a hand of poker in eleven months and was hoping to just play good enough to get lucky and bink something.  I made money and it was by all means a successful trip but I was pretty disappointed in myself for going 0/11 in the bracelet events.  At the end of the series last year I told myself I would be better prepared this time around and ready to play to the best of my abilities for the full six weeks.  </p>
<p>For the past couple of months I&#8217;ve been playing <a href="https://sealswithclubs.eu/aff.php?aff=311/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://sealswithclubs.eu']);"><strong>bitcoin poker</strong></a> almost every day, railing and analyzing the nosebleed games, and watching strategy vids and discussing hands with friends.  I haven&#8217;t done a great job of working out, but I&#8217;m really going to try to make that a priority over the next two months as it plays a big role in the marathon that is the wsop.  I plan on playing 25-30 events hopefully and have rented a house with a ton of poker players this time.  There&#8217;s a eleven of us in a five bedroom house but not everyone&#8217;s there the whole time.</p>
<p>In other news I <strong>bought a condo</strong>!  I don&#8217;t close for another twenty five days but I see no reason why the sale shouldn&#8217;t go through so I&#8217;m pretty excited.  My wife and I ended up spending a bit more than we were initially planning, but it&#8217;s a nice place and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be happy there.  It&#8217;s a 2 BR/1 BA in belltown in a nice building with all the amenities hot tub, gym, rooftop deck etc.  The negotiations went well.  The place was listed for $475k, we offered $450k, they countered at $465k.  At this point our realtor urged us to take the deal.  The place had been on the market less than a week and good places sell very quickly in Seattle.  A couple other condos we were contemplating making offers on in the past would be under contract a day later before we made up our minds.  I decided to ignore the realtors advice however and gamboool and offer $460k which they ended up accepting.  It was risky because they had an extra 24 hours to shop that offer around to other potential buys to try and get a higher offer but it ended up paying off so we&#8217;re happy.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s enough boring life updates I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re just here for the poker strat!  I downloaded <a href="https://www.pokersnowie.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.pokersnowie.com']);"><strong>Pokersnowie</strong></a> today as I&#8217;d heard about and thought I&#8217;d check it out(no they didn&#8217;t pay me to write a review, although if they read this and would like to retroactively I will happily accept donations <img src='http://andr3w321.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ).  I played about 200 hands of headsup NL vs it and apparently it didn&#8217;t think I played too badly:</p>
<p><a href="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-analysis.png" ><img src="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-analysis-300x203.png" alt="" title="pokersnowie analysis" width="300" height="203" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1841" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately I can&#8217;t say the same for it.  In reality I&#8217;m by no means a world class HU NL player and I&#8217;m pretty confident the best ones would be able to beat this bot for a healthy winrate.  Having said that it&#8217;s pretty fun to play and I think it could improve your game quite a lot &#8211; certainly well enough to be able to beat midstakes.  Below are two hands it says I played badly and I think it played badly and don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s even close.</p>
<p><a href="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-rivercall.png" ><img src="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-rivercall-300x202.png" alt="" title="pokersnowie rivercall" width="300" height="202" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1844" /></a></p>
<p>The hand went I minraised button, and the bot check/called every street.  Evaluating the bot&#8217;s play there&#8217;s no way that check/calling on the river is a better play than going all in.  If you notice it shows that the EV of calling is 31.93 bets and calling is only 11.93 bets.  It&#8217;s really hard to make backdoor flushes especially out of position.  You might say yeah I mean he has the best hand 90% of the time but when he&#8217;s called he&#8217;s behind 70% of the time, but vs an actual human player there&#8217;s no way this is the case.  Most humans are going to have a very hard time folding 2 pair+ to the raise and if they are folding 2pair+ to the raise every time well&#8230; it&#8217;s going to be pretty easy exploiting them by just check raising them every single time we get to the river with a hand that doesn&#8217;t beat AT since the in position guy will have a strong Ace thru top set much more often than he will have a flush.</p>
<p>Evaluating my play it says my bet with the AT is a mistake.  I disagree.  Most human players are going to be check raising their 2pair+ sometime before the river, so I basically lose to A9,J2s,J3s(24 hands), A2,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,24,25,26,27,28,29,2T,2Q,2K of clubs though some of these will be 3bet preflop sometimes(15 hands) and the occasional random backdoor flush or slowplay.  I beat A4,A5,A6,A7,A8 both offsuit and suited non clubs(75 hands).  I chop with AT and most people will 3bet AJ-AK.  Most people fold J2o, J3o preflop.  That&#8217;s 39 hands I&#8217;m beat by and 75 hands I beat.  Even if I add in all A2 and A3 combos that only adds about 30 hand combos making it still a value bet.  The only way this is not a value bet is if the oop guy is never check raising this board on the flop or turn.  This may be optimal, but in practice most humans I think will have a flop or turn check raising range.</p>
<p>The second hand I disagree with pokersnowie on is a paired board where again it went I minraise button and the bot check/calls three streets with a very strong hand instead of check raising the river.</p>
<p><a href="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-rivercall2.png" ><img src="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pokersnowie-rivercall2-300x203.png" alt="" title="pokersnowie rivercall2" width="300" height="203" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1847" /></a></p>
<p>This is such a strong hand and very easy river checkraise.  I think worse hands that bet/call in my spot are any 7 so Q7,T7,97,87,76,74(96 hands).  Better hands that bet/call are all boats so K7,J7,75,KK,JJ,55(66 hands).  55 probably checks the flop or turn and A7 chops obviously.  Interestingly, Q7 is actually a losing river check raise.  It beats 80 hands vs 98 hands it loses to.  Of course this is all based on these bet/call ranges which or may not be correct but for humans I think they&#8217;re pretty close.  You could add in a 73s,72s,73o for button opening ranges and some people may hero call AK or KJ which would probably push Q7 to a check raise, but that&#8217;s very villain and read dependent.</p>
<p>Evaluating my play it thinks the K8 river bet is a mistake.  I&#8217;m going to be barreling most gutshots AQ,AT,QT,T9,89 and plenty of diamond flush draws on the turn and bluffing many of these on the river.  I need to be value betting thinly to balance for this.  I&#8217;m not going to go through all the exact combos for this one, but very similar to the previous hand if the oop player has any sort of flop or turn check raising range which 90% of players do this is a very easy value bet.</p>
<p>My other big complaint is the level of accuracy it gives.  It should be giving a range of EV where its 90% confident or something.  Not exact EV down the the decimal point for each bet.  When reviewing my &#8220;errors&#8221; it says I made it would bring up all these spots where calling might be -0.03 bets and folding was 0 bets and says I made a mistake by calling.  There&#8217;s no way it can provably say for example that I am losing money by calling a 3x raise with 96o from the bb like it believes.  Also when I made a bet size it didn&#8217;t like it would tell me I was making an error by betting 2/3 instead of 1/2 pot in a single raised pot.  There&#8217;s very little chance that is a provable mistake.  The errors should be organized in largest to smallest and ones that fall under statistically insignificant or too small to be proven shouldn&#8217;t come up as errors IMO.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they will get there eventually but for now I actually feel pretty good about man vs machines chances at heads up NL.</p>

											<p>1. <strong>Manage my time better.</strong>  This is my main goal and all other goals are really a subset of this goal.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Wake up and go to bed at regular times.</strong>  I&#8217;ve been self employed for over six years now and waking up early and regularly is something I&#8217;ve struggled with as long as I can remember.  Waking up late prevents me from having a very productive day and achieving my goals quicker than I otherwise would if I woke up early.  Over the years I&#8217;ve learned a couple tricks to help me like <a href="http://andr3w321.com/an-all-too-common-day/" >practicing waking up</a>, going to bed early the night before, and most of all doing it regularly since it takes about a week for your sleep schedule to adjust.  Hopefully I can change that in 2014.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Read less 2+2/reddit.</strong>  I&#8217;ve grown into a schedule of browsing the internet for an hour or two when I first wake up and right before I go to bed.  Sometimes I read and learn interesting things, but usually I just end up reading random semi entertaining threads like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1tiics/if_a_player_has_a_prosthetic_arm_that_he_used_for/ce8c151" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.reddit.com']);">If a player has a prosthetic arm that he used for holding onto the football and the arm got detached during the play, would that be considered a fumble or would the prosthetic limb still have possession for the player?</a>  In the morning it stops me from being productive, and in the evening it tends to keep me up later than I want to stay up and prevents me from being productive the next day.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever kick the habit for good, but I&#8217;d like to decrease the amount of time I spend randomly browsing to focus on more productive or entertaining things.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Read more books.</strong>  I&#8217;m somewhat embarrassed to say I only read 1.5 books last year.  This is the least number I&#8217;ve read in a year since I was probably 12.  I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062238868/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=0062238868&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andr3w321poke-20" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=andr3w321poke-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0062238868" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061438294/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=0061438294&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andr3w321poke-20" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent&#8217;s Guide to Speed-Reading People</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=andr3w321poke-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0061438294" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />  Reading novels has been shown to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/brain-function-boosted-for-days-after-reading-a-novel-9028302.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.independent.co.uk']);">boost brain function for days</a>  It increases your vocabulary and provides much deeper explanation on topics that you just can&#8217;t get from tweets and short internet articles which takes up the majority of young people&#8217;s reading sources these days.  Plus at 1.5 books/year I&#8217;m getting dangerously close to becoming like Kanye West:</p>
<p><a href="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kanye-west-on-books.jpg" ><img src="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kanye-west-on-books.jpg" alt="kanye west on books" title="kanye west on books" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1831" /></a></p>
<p>5. <strong>Exercise more.</strong>  Pretty standard resolution here.  Three times a week is what I&#8217;m shooting for.  Maybe I will finally run that marathon this year I&#8217;ve been wanting to for awhile now, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Blog at least once a month.</strong>  I started tweeting a bit in 2013 and it kind of replaced my urge to blog, but there&#8217;s just some things you can&#8217;t get out in 140 characters.  I don&#8217;t think 12 blogs per year is asking too much of my time.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Watch less TV.</strong>  Spend more time reading books and working out instead.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Grow my businesses.  Buy a house.</strong>  These are pretty vague goals which are generally bad for goal making, but I&#8217;ll take these more on a month to month basis.  In January I&#8217;d like to focus on <a href="http://bitcoinrichlist.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bitcoinrichlist.com']);">BitcoinRichList.com</a> and then on poker for Australia and the Aussie millions.  In February I&#8217;d like to focus more on ATMs and condo buying.</p>
<p>Happy new year and best of luck to you all in 2014!</p>

											<p>Follow me @andr3w321  I&#8217;ve been at it for a couple weeks now and it&#8217;s much less time consuming and easier to do at the table while I&#8217;m playing and doesn&#8217;t cut into sleeping or eating time.  </p>
<p>I made day 2 of the main event with 28k in chips, play resumes tomorrow.  I bricked every wsop tourny I played, but I did get four cashes in Carnivale events and am currently tied as the TLB leader here: <a href="http://www.wsop.com/players/2013.asp" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.wsop.com']);">http://www.wsop.com/players/2013.asp</a>  My housemate Matt Ashton has seriously one upped me however and is the current wsop player of the year leader!  I&#8217;ll probably write a proper wsop wrapup at the end of the series, but for now I&#8217;m focused on playing and resting.  Best of luck to anyone else still in the main!</p>

											<p>I made day 2 of the $2,500 8 game.  My chips aren&#8217;t great, about half average at 8k, but I&#8217;m still in it.  40 get paid and 192 people are left.  I had quite a bit of nerves for the first two hours of play or so since I haven&#8217;t played live in year, but after that they went away and after four hours of play I started really feeling comfortable and confident again.</p>
<p>My table draw was pretty tough.  I had Daniel Negreanu, David Williams and four other fairly tough guys at my table.  There was one live one, some russian guy obv, but he busted halfway through the day.  People seemed to play alright, but some are horrible at O8 and Triple Draw.  In triple draw, I saw people coldcall and draw 3, open 348 utg, stand pat with a Ten to start etc.</p>
<p>The most interesting hand I played was vs Negreanu.  I came very close to busting Negreanu, but it was not meant to be.  In PLO, the cutoff opened and I cold called AsKc8s3c on the button, Negreanu defended his big blind.  Flop came down 974 with two spades and Negreanu leads out for 2/3 pot.  Cutoff folds, and I ask Negreanu how much he has left.  He was pretty toned down from what you see on TV for most of the day, but in this hand he really came alive.  </p>
<p>&#8220;About 2100.  You want to put me in?  You can put me in if you want?  Go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I normally don&#8217;t get intimidated by pros, but this was still like level 4 or so and I haven&#8217;t played poker in awhile.  He has a very big table presence when he wants to and he makes it hard to think, I almost did what he wanted and put it in right there.  Instead, I end up calling.  He starts bantering again, </p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re going make me think.  Why can&#8217;t you just put it in and make my life easy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The turn was an offsuit 8.  He shoves and I think for a bit.  He starts talking again, </p>
<p>&#8220;What do you have JT or something like that?  You should probably call.  Look at this guy.  Probably doing math or something and just wants me to shutup.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I reply &#8220;pretty much&#8221;  Because I am doing math and trying to figure out pot odds and my equity.  With my pair plus flush draw have equity to call if he just has 97, but I&#8217;m drawing pretty badly if he has a straight.  I tank for a bit and end up calling, but his flopped 3 pair holds up and he doubles through me.</p>

											<p>I got here last night.  The flight from Seattle to Vegas is super easy.  Direct and only two hours.  I&#8217;m happy to say my roommate Matt Ashton is already deep in the $2,500 Stud 8/Omaha 8 or better event.  Wish him luck!  There&#8217;s 19 left and he&#8217;s currently 9th in chips.  I&#8217;m playing the 8 game event later today and just trying to relax and chill by the pool til then.  Hopefully my poker skill aren&#8217;t TOO rusty or they come back to me quickly.</p>

											<p>Title says it all.  I&#8217;m heading out to Vegas next week for my annual wsop pilgrimage.  I&#8217;ll try and blog about every event I play like I do every year so check back for updates!  I&#8217;m planning on playing ten to fifteen events, more than I&#8217;ve ever played.  Last year I only played seven including the main event.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be there for thirty days in June. Four of these days my fiancee will be visiting so I won&#8217;t play any during that time.  I&#8217;m not rich/crazy enough to play two events in one day so if I busted out on day one of every event I played the max I could play is ~25 events.  Add to this the fact that I won&#8217;t play anything over a $3k buyin, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll spend some days drinking by the pool and I don&#8217;t really like the $1k events or PLO events(both have too shallow starting stacks IMO).  I&#8217;ll probably end up playing ten to fifteen events.  It seems like every other year you hear about a guy who never played PLO in his life ended up winning the $1.5k PLO.  This is a pretty good indicator this event is more luck than skill in my opinion. </p>
<p>I figured I&#8217;d do some math so I could come in with realistic expectations for my results.  Last year I cashed two out of my seven events and clearly ran better than expected.  I figure a good cash % is around 15% and a good final table % is around 2.5%, but these are clearly just guesses.  Based on these numbers, <strong>if I play ten events I can expect</strong></p>
<p>To cash in 1-2 events (10*.15=1.5)<br />
I have a 25% chance of final tabling a single event (10*.025=.25)<br />
There is a 20% chance I don&#8217;t cash in any events (.85^10=.2)<br />
On average I should expect to go about four events before my first cash (.85^4=.52)</p>
<p><strong>If I play fifteen events, I can expect</strong></p>
<p>To cash in 2 events (15*.15=2.25)<br />
I have a 37.5% chance of final tabling a single event (15*.025=.375)<br />
There is a 9% chance I don&#8217;t cash in any events (.85^15=.09)<br />
On average I should still expect to go about four events before my first cash</p>
<p>I&#8217;d REALLY like to make my first final table this year, but clearly the odds are not in my favor.  More volume definitely translates into a better expectations, but honestly if I go 0-10 I may call it quits.  Losing $20k straight is never fun.  I&#8217;ve been trying to work out regularly and doing my best to play some bitcoin poker and play money poker on pokerstars in preparation.  I have no doubt I&#8217;m a shell of the player I once was a couple years ago, but I would like to think I have more experience and am wiser for it even if some of my raising/calling ranges aren&#8217;t as profitable as they once were.  I still like my odds vs all the $1.5k wsop donks.  Best of luck at the wsop.  I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to it and hope you are too!</p>

											<p>I&#8217;ve been following bitcoins pretty closely for the past ten days now and the market has been insanely volatile and highly entertaining.  Here&#8217;s the chart</p>
<p><a href="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoin-chart1.jpg" ><img src="http://andr3w321.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoin-chart1-300x103.jpg" alt="" title="bitcoin chart" width="300" height="103" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1757" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s gone from $50 to $260 all the way back to $60 in the past thirty days.  I first heard about bitcoins a couple years ago back in 2011.  I got a couple free ones from the bitcoin faucet and played around with them for a bit.  I thought they were interesting, but ultimately useless unless they gained widespread adoption.  Well lately, as a result of the crazy price increases they&#8217;ve been all over the news and some legitimate merchants have started accepting them.  Some people think it&#8217;s a bubble, some call it a pyramid scheme, some think they&#8217;ll be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars one day.  Whatever your opinion it&#8217;s been a wild ride lately.  The TV news interviews you see about them are obviously done by people completely clueless about them, however, and they always have these two very basic questions so for you newbies out there I&#8217;ll go ahead and answer them for you.</p>
<p><strong>What are bitcoins?</strong><br />
Bitcoins are basically just numbers stored in a database(blockchain) linked to a bitcoin address.  Similarly, dollars are just numbers stored in a database linked to a bank account.</p>
<p><strong>Can&#8217;t some hacker just create a bunch of bitcoins?</strong><br />
No.  Creating bitcoins requires a tremendous amount of computing power.  Just how no human can multiply two 100 digit numbers in their head, a single computer can&#8217;t just magically create a bunch of bitcoins.</p>
<p><strong>Differences between dollars and bitcoins</strong></p>
<p>1. Fixed supply<br />
Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.  The number of US dollars that can ever exist is infinity.<br />
2. Money supply over time<br />
The numbers of both currencies is constantly changing, however, bitcoins follows a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.bitcoin.it']);">fixed predictable schedule</a>.  As of April 11, 2013 there are 11,022,500 bitcoins and something like 10 trillion US dollars.  In 2014 there will be 11,812,500 bitcoins.  In 2020 there will be 17,718,750 bitcoins.  I have no idea how many US dollars will exist next year, or ten years from now.  Nobody does.  The federal reserve controls and manipulates the money supply daily.  They increase or decrease the money supply by changing bank reserve requirements, buying or selling T-bills, or changing the discount rate.<br />
3. Issuing authority<br />
All dollars are ultimately created by the federal reserve.  All bitcoins are created by thousands of individual bitcoin miners.  No one miner is in control.  Right now about 3600 new bitcoins are created a day.  Miners do pool their resources into various <a href="http://blockchain.info/pools" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://blockchain.info']);">mining pools</a>, but no miner pool can ever reach 51% of the hash power or there will be problems.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of bitcoins</strong></p>
<p>1. 24/7 Speedy Service<br />
Bitcoin transactions can happen anywhere, anytime and be confirmed within 10 minutes usually. Normal banks are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday and transactions usually take 1-2 business days to become confirmed.</p>
<p>2. Low Transaction Fees<br />
Bitcoins <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.bitcoin.it']);">transaction fees</a> are 0.0005 BTC per transaction(okay not exactly, but pretty much, click the link for more details).  At $100 USD/BTC that&#8217;s equivalent to five cents.  A normal credit card transaction will cost the merchant a 3% fee with a minimum fee of 25 cents.  A typical wire transfer costs $25 send and sometimes a fee on the receiving end as well.</p>
<p>3. Everyone has a merchant account<br />
If you want to start accepting bitcoins all you need is a bitcoin address.  You don&#8217;t have to be approved by a credit card company and pay them fees once you are accepted.  It&#8217;s as simple as pasting people your bank account number(bitcoin address) and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>4. Ease of transport<br />
If you want to carry $20k in cash with you to Vegas it&#8217;s risky.  You can lose it, someone can rob you, and authorities can confiscate it and there&#8217;s not much you can do about it.  Just ask <a href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/19/high-stakes-pl-nl/warning-high-stakes-travelers-398198/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com']);">Viffer</a>  With bitcoins you just need to remember a password and that&#8217;s all you really need.</p>
<p>5. No Chargebacks<br />
If you sell an item on ebay and accept paypal money, confirm the shipment, but the customer says they never received it, or lies and says it&#8217;s broken and paypal will issue a refund and you are out your money or item and there&#8217;s not much you can do about it.  Bitcoins are one way transactions and irreversible(pretty much).</p>
<p><strong>Cons of bitcoins</strong></p>
<p>1. No Chargebacks<br />
If someone steals your credit or debit card number you can call up your bank and get your fraudulent transactions reversed.  If someone steals your bitcoin wallet there&#8217;s not much you can do.  That&#8217;s why keeping your bitcoin private key secure and encrypting your wallet is so important.</p>
<p>2. You can delete bitcoins<br />
Sure you can burn dollars too, but no one accidentally does that.  If you lose your wallet your money is gone.  Ever had a hardrive crash?  Ever accidentally deleted a file you weren&#8217;t supposed to?  Backups are important.</p>
<p>3. If your computer gets hacked you can lose all your money<br />
If you visit the wrong website or open the wrong e-mail attachment you can lose all the money in your account.  This is very scary stuff.  Backups and security are your friend.  Bank level security is wonderful and has had many, many years to mature.  Bitcoins have existed for four years now.  It&#8217;s going to take awhile(maybe never) for systems to emerge for the average joe to feel comfortable putting money into bitcoins.</p>
<p>4. Not many merchants accept bitcoins<br />
This may change in the future, and new merchants sign up daily, but right now if you want to buy something with bitcoins you pretty much have to convert bitcoins to USD which makes the whole thing pretty pointless.</p>
<p>5. High volatility<br />
Price stability is important for bitcoins to succeed in the long run.  No one wants their money to be worth 50% of what it was worth yesterday.  The US dollar fluctuates maybe 3% a year vs most other currencies.  In the short run speculation will drive price, but bitcoin will need to eventually become lower volatility for it to ever work as a legitimate currency.</p>
<p>6. Hoarding<br />
Due to the fixed supply of bitcoins they are susceptible to hoarding.  If their coins are worth more tomorrow then they are today why would people spend them or invest them in other commodities?  Well, US dollars used to be based on the gold standard and there is a fixed amount of gold on the planet.  People still spent US dollars just fine.  It&#8217;s all a matter of how much the value of BTC increase over time.  A deflationary spiral is definitely possible and could create bubbles like we&#8217;re possibly seeing now, which could ultimately undermine confidence in bitcoins as a currency.</p>

											<p>Well it&#8217;s been a busy two weeks.  Obviously I didn&#8217;t update throughout the weekend like I was hoping but here&#8217;s a rundown of what happened.  </p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> People pitched maybe 50 ideas.  All the ideas were put up on the wall and then we voted on the best 20 or so and formed teams around them.  We then all went home by 10pm as the building was closing.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> This was the major workday.  I got there a bit before 9am and we worked for 12+ hours until the building closed again at 10pm.  A few people never showed up for the next day and a couple teams went by the wayside.  I guess this was inevitable, but it&#8217;s kind of oddly funny seeing the teams shrink over the weekend.  We probably had one of the biggest teams.  We started with around 10 and by Satuday it was down to 8.  We also had a lot of developers.  6 of us wrote code and the guy whose idea it was and a microsoft PM on our team worked on the market research validation side.  I certainly learned a lot as it was the first time I&#8217;d really coded in a group.  The fact that we had so many devs was both a blessing and a curse in my opinion.  We spent most of our time coding and actually got a working demo going where as most of the other teams just had mockups or non working html files with no backend, but I think we were weak on the presentation and market validation side of things.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> This was presentation day and most of our time was spent meeting with advisors, preparing the presentation and finishing up some coding.  Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t win.  That award went to <a href="http://corki.io" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://corki.io']);">corki</a> a wine menu rating converter app.  If you&#8217;re interested you can see the pitches <a href="http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2019716276_video_startup_weekend_seattle.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com']);">here</a>  Our pitch was around the one hour mark.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short highlight video of the event where I make a cameo around the 10 second mark.</p>

<p>The site is live right now <a href="http://www.tonightsplaylist.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.tonightsplaylist.com']);">tonightsplaylist.com</a>  It doesn&#8217;t look too different from the initial launch right now.  Our team has met once since the event and made a bunch of backend code changes that you can&#8217;t see.  Overall it was a great learning experience and I&#8217;d definitely do another one.</p>

											<p>I signed up for <a href="http://seattle.startupweekend.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://seattle.startupweekend.org']);">http://seattle.startupweekend.org/</a> this weekend.  The idea is you get a bunch of people together interested in starting a company(usually an app or website), everyone pitches their ideas, you vote on the best ones and form teams around them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only Friday, but it&#8217;s been fun so far.  Everyone has been really friendly and I&#8217;ve met a lot of like minded people.  I joined &#8220;Tonight&#8217;s Playlist&#8221;  It&#8217;s basically pandora for local bands that are playing concerts in your town tonight/this weekend.  We have a big group, maybe 10 or so in total.  It will be interesting to see how this evolves and what we create.  I&#8217;ll try to update over the weekend on our progress.</p>

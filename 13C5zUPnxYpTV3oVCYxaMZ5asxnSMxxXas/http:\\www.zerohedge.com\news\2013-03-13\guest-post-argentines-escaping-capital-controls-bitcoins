<meta name="description" content="Submitted by Simon Black of Sovereign Man blog, Several hundred miles east of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the mighty Kasai river forms the boundary between two little known tribes of central Africa-- the Bushong and the Lele. Ostensibly there should be scant difference between the two; they're separated only by a river, and they share a common language, art, and ancestry. Yet their economic differences between are vast. As anthropologist Mary Douglas put it, &quot;The Lele are poor, while the Bushong are rich... Everything that the Lele have or can do, the Bushong have more and can do better.&quot; We've seen these differences before-- East vs West Germany. North vs. South Korea. Similar people, different ideals. On one side, economic freedom flourishes. On the other, it's central planning and totalitarian control. South America is becoming a similar case study, with the Andes forming a sort of &quot;Golden Curtain&quot; separating two clear sides. On this side, the Chilean economy is thriving. The peso is strong. Corruption is low. Economic freedom is high. And their standard of living is rising. On the other side of the Andes, President Cristina Fernandez has a stranglehold over what's left of the Argentine economy. Inflation is rampant, corruption is incorrigible, and freedom is waning. We've talked about this before; a month ago, I was in Buenos Aires on the day that Fernandez announced a ban on coupon-style advertising, just days after she imposed a price freeze at grocery stores around the country. Price controls, media controls... they're all part of the same tired playbook that morally bankrupt politicians in financially bankrupt countries have routinely fallen back on for centuries. Fernandez's most insidious move has been to FORCE Argentines to hold the rapidly depreciating Argentine peso. She has restricted her people from changing pesos into other currencies, including gold, as well as created obstacles to move funds abroad." />

  <div class="content"><p><em>Submitted by Simon Black of <a href="http://www.sovereignman.com">Sovereign Man blog</a>,</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Several hundred miles east of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the mighty Kasai river forms the boundary between two little known tribes of central Africa-- the Bushong and the Lele.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Ostensibly there should be scant difference between the two; they're separated only by a river, and they share a common language, art, and ancestry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Yet their economic differences between are vast. As anthropologist Mary Douglas put it, "The Lele are poor, while the Bushong are rich... Everything that the Lele have or can do, the Bushong have more and can do better."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We've seen these differences before-- East vs West Germany. North vs. South Korea. Similar people, different ideals. On one side, economic freedom flourishes. On the other, it's central planning and totalitarian control. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">South America is becoming a similar case study</span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">, with the Andes forming a sort of "Golden Curtain" separating two clear sides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On this side, the Chilean economy is thriving. The peso is strong. Corruption is low. Economic freedom is high. And their standard of living is rising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On the other side of the Andes, President Cristina Fernandez has a stranglehold over what's left of the Argentine economy. Inflation is rampant, corruption is incorrigible, and freedom is waning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We've talked about this before; a month ago, I was in Buenos Aires on the day that Fernandez announced a ban on coupon-style advertising, just days after she imposed a price freeze at grocery stores around the country.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Price controls, media controls... they're all part of the same tired playbook that morally bankrupt politicians in financially bankrupt countries have routinely fallen back on for centuries.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Fernandez's most insidious move has been to FORCE Argentines to hold the rapidly depreciating Argentine peso. She has restricted her people from changing pesos into other currencies, including gold, as well as created obstacles to move funds abroad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Many Argentines have reached their breaking points and are doing something about it. We're seeing this first hand by the steady stream of Argentine citizens lining up at the immigration office in Santiago seeking residency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My friend Sir Charles at PricedinGold.com wrote me this morning from Argentina's Salta province (near Doug Casey's lovely property in Cafayate) and told me that TEA Turismo, a local tour operator and rental car agency there has started accepting BITCOINS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">If you're not familiar, bitcoins are digital currency units that are not controlled by any government. Bitcoins can be exchanged for goods, services, and other currencies, privately and anonymously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">For obvious reasons, Bitcoins are becoming increasingly popular in Argentina as people seek any means necessary to survive the economic destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Needless to say, it would have been a hell of a lot easier to take these steps BEFORE it all hit the fan... not after. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This is an important lesson for the rest of us</span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">. There are consequences to printing money with wanton abandon. There are consequences to reaching an unsustainable debt situation. And, when the writing is on the wall, there are consequences when you delay taking action to protect yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Diversifying income, assets, and personal interests abroad is a critical aspect of this. International diversification is something that the wealthy have been doing for centuries. But with so much modern technology at our disposal, these options are now available to ANYONE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">At least, while the window of opportunity is still open.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The pace of Draconian legislation is changing the landscape quickly</span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">. Very quickly. That's why I put together the Offshore Tactics Workshop we're holding here in Chile at the end of this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It's too late to sign up for the event... the workshop sold out a few months ago almost immediately. But I've hired a professional Hollywood crew to film every minute of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Quite simply, the event (and the video kit) will showcase the most powerful set of actionable international diversification options ever presented, along with step-by-step instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Ship your IRA overseas? Set up a rock solid trust and foreign bank account?&nbsp; Establish residency in Chile? Move gold abroad? Contact these exact people, and follow these precise steps, 1, 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">To be completely candid, there's simply no one else out there with the experience or contacts to be able to deliver such a vast array of experts and actionable intelligence. </span></p>

    <p>Geez, a few people in SA started using bitcoins and the price has exploded $10 to $45 in a month or so. Just wait till it goes mainstream in 1 or 2 countries like this, then a few more, then the USoA.</p>

    <p>All those who laugh at bitcoin will buy it when TBTF or currencies collapse. &nbsp;EVERYONE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As TSHTF you might just suddenly discover that you have to send value to your kid or family member 10 military checkpoints away, by then you will come to some thug that has bitcoin, and you will beg him to take your junk silver for it. &nbsp;Not having bitcoin is a major mistake, I believe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But who am I to say anything? &nbsp;Just one more fucking moron on ZH.</p>

    <p>I've actually done my last 10 purchases on GunBroker via BTC. &nbsp;In the same manner that PM's didn't make sense to most just 4 years ago (and still even today), BTC falls in the same realm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it's digital. &nbsp;Yes there's risk just like anything else but I for one like having the added option of not needing to back up the truck and move all my PM's around should that time come. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bubble / speculation it may be, but I got in last year thanks to Mr. Keiser so I ain't complainin'.</p>

    <p>Ya know, I'm getting tired of all this bitching and complaining about BitCoin.&nbsp; Or bitCoin or Bit Coin or however the fuck it's actually spelled.&nbsp; I'm going to try it.&nbsp; I'm certainly not going up to my eyeballs in it, but I'll load up maybe a grand and try using it for real-world stuff.&nbsp; Hell, it's all just fiat anyway, right?</p>
<p>I just can not possibly even understand the discussion if I've never tried it and have no frame of reference.</p>
<p>Plus it appeals to my inner "diversification demon".&nbsp; Not all eggs in one basket (nor gold in one tragic boating or sinkhole&nbsp;accident).</p>
<p>Ya fucking happy now?&nbsp; I'm gonna try it.&nbsp; You got a convert.&nbsp; Now leave me the fuck alone for a few months.&nbsp; If the black helicopters come flying up over the ridge at me or my internet connection mysteriously fails, well,&nbsp;I guess you'll be waiting a lot longer than a few months to hear back from me.&nbsp; But when I come back with my verdict on this very unusual "currency" I won't be taking and crap from those who haven't actually used it.</p>

<p><span>In the future IF bitcoins gain any real form of popularity besides this current honeymoon phase of early adopters, you can bet your sweet ass there will be just as many counter-measures put in place by authorities with Utah-sized data centres, bullshit crazy computer power and unlimited funding to discover who is sending packages across the internet out of clear view of Saurons eyeball. Just having some obfuscation on your packets will be enough to focus Saurons eye on you if the authorities get their internet laws in place. It's all just the beginning of this stuff, the beginning of bitcoins and the beginning of a draconian internet. At some point their paths will cross and you don't want to be holding the bag of bitcoins when that happens.</span></p>
<p><span>I agree if you have money to spare, play the bitcoin roulette and if your lucky you might make some money but if your listening to the hype and thinking they'll be worth a $100,000 or a million dollars in the future and plan to pour your money into them to get rich - your going to be left holding a bunch of rotten tulips.</span></p>
<p><span>BitCoins have a long hard road ahead of them before becoming anything other than a novelty.</span></p>

    <p>Yeah, because a gov't that is too incompetent to win any war or to even run a fucking postal office will *simultaneously* break RIPEMD160() &amp; SHA256() &amp; Private keys. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a single Bradley Manning warning people. &nbsp;No amount of violence can break the laws of mathematics.</p>

    <p>The wars aren't to be won, they are to be dragged out for contracting, big money profits and especially for human behaviour and crowd control studies to prepare humanity for the next phase of their New Order. Haven't you worked that out yet? They could win any war they wanted pressing the right buttons but what advantage does that bring them when these wars have never been a contest they are trying to win.</p>
<p>Running super high tech facillities to control the internet and EVERYTHING that passes across the exchanges is exactly what they are spending their time on - it's part of the larger war effort by the control freaks.</p>
<p>Look it up, hit up google and do some research on the other side of the technology - the NSA and DOD have already been running steganalysis programs for years and are well aware they need to be able to identify and even break these methods. It's not something only the super smart bitcoins uses know about even if they think that's the case, the spooks are well aware of it and working on having an answer to it.</p>
<p>While i think bitcoins can make money in the short term, any success they gain into the future will be thwarted by a much larger brain trust with unlimited funding and technology that will render them useless if their only use now is privacy.</p>
<p>My point is - don't be the last one holding the bag. Make your money now, buy them low, sell them high but don't listen to the calls of $100,000 or a Million$ because ANY success for bitcoins will result in a 10 fold attempt by the spooks to identify and counter their use. That's the fundemental problem for bitcoins and there's no legit answer to that problem - only because right now it isn't an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make money on lots of early startup concepts but most fail after the initial hype. What bitcoins needs is some assurance they won't fail when Saurons eye notices them, unti then it's not a legit investment for people to park money into, you might as well just gamble on football or tennis if you want to flip your money quickly. Bet on Federer and Djokovic since they win 95/100 times. That's easy money too.</p>

    <p>They're breaking Swiss banking secrecy laws as we speak. Once upon a time, these were considered inviolable too. Where the money is that's needed to preserve the entrenched power structure, they'll go, and find a way to collect their due. Either by brute force attacks, or finessing the right resources behind scenes. I've seen too many scientists declare things to be impossible, until it turned out they weren't. Airplane impacts will never cause the World Trade towers to collapse. "Oh, we were thinking only about the impact forces, we didn't consider the effect of burning jet fuel." We only need to make the sea walls around the Fukushima power plant able to withstand a 5.7 meter tsunami, because powerful earthquakes don't happen here. "Oh, we didn't <em>realize</em> there was a subduction zone off the coast capable of causing megathrust earthquakes."</p>
<p>It's not that the laws of physics and mathematics are flawed. It's the scientists/engineers who consistently mistake all the contingencies they're aware of for all the contingencies that are possible that are the issue.</p>
<p>At least you can hide your gold in little pockets buried all over the place, if that is your wont. But the internet can have its plug pulled in one fell swoop, should the powers that be decide it's in their best interests. As indeed the US government is trying to get the right to do even now. Good luck digging up your bitcoins from their virtual hidey holes then.</p>

    <p>The "internet" as we know it will evolve and adapt into P2P darknets.&nbsp; What we can't do, we code towards.&nbsp; Where we can't get, we route around.&nbsp; What we want to hide, we encrypt.&nbsp; Look for the unintended consequence dupes in government to push for more internet legislation.&nbsp; The end result will be an increase in robustness, privacy and ease of use.</p>

    <p>I don't know why you bother anymore Half_A_Billion... I have better things to do than to waste time talking about BTC on ZH anymore but good on ya'.</p>
<p>Hey look!  Just one day after the "crash" in which a global currency was fixed in 25 minutes and all the BTC slag pumpers on ZH were wetting their pants talking like it went to zero, it's higher and demand is strengthening markedly.</p>
<p>All I can do is laugh at most ZH comments on BTC now because the majority of them are made by people that don't have the faintest idea what they're talking about.</p>

    <p>It's like a sociological experiment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We've all read all those stories about the morons at Xerox showing the entire mac to Steve Jobs, who stole it all; the stories of the morons at yahoo who didn't buy google for 100k (or something like that), the massive takeover of linux, wikipedia, and so on and so forth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we are again on the start of a great breakthrough, a key moment of creative destruction, and it's just fucking FUN to see that some people simply do not know what's coming. &nbsp;They simply cannot see it--by any means. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When bitcoin fell to $4.50 last year I screamed to a very close friend "you have to run and get this shit now", and he said "yeah, sounds good". &nbsp;The phrase that I hear most frequently by my close friends is: "goddammit I should have bought some btc". &nbsp; Last week he comes to me and says, "you should have screamed more, put a gun to my head," and so on. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>OK, so currencys "collapse", and our friend "Half a Billion" assumes the internet will just go chugging along as if nothing happened. I don't know whether BitCoin will survive and prosper or crash and burn, but I am always constantly amazed that kids, sitting in front of their computers or smart phones all day long, have total faith in all the infrastructure that goes into allowing us to use these devices. Really, if you think currencys are going to collapse, this implies far more serious disruptions to our society than you might imagine. Consider yourself lucky to have electricity for an hour a day under those dire circumstances.</p>

    <p>I have nothing against bitcoins. &nbsp;Or any other alternative currency.</p>
<p>But you bring up a very important point. &nbsp;If things go really downhill, the last thing we are going to have is electricity and functioning networks.</p>
<p>If things muddle along they way they are and we have some semblance of normalcy, bitcoins are not going to reach the value that many propose. &nbsp;If it becomes a large enough threat it will be stomped out.</p>
<p>And since a very small minority have or use bitcoins, the majority will have little problem stomping out the minority's rights. (Ask Bernard von Nothaus how that works. &nbsp;And a Bitcoin is a COIN.)</p>
<p>Same as it ever was.</p>
<p>Riddle me this, what if there was a concerted effort on the part of our alphabet soup agencies to show the al CIA Duh was using bitcoins to move their dirty terrist money around?</p>
<p>Not only would most be afraid to accept them, but those who have them would be sitting on a digital pile of treason.</p>
<p>Compare that with gold or silver, which is recognized and accepted almost anywhere in any conditions, and the answer is pretty simple.</p>

    <p>That is something I have been researching. &nbsp;Here in the east, it is tough to find land to prospect (all private) and detecting is even worse (civil war sites, etc off limits). &nbsp;There is the beach though. &nbsp;Most of the gold I have come across is small, and even a pinpointer coil would miss so I would be limited to coin shooting.</p>
<p>I should still be researching, but someo of they yellow showed up in my test pans. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <p>Well said pods, my thoughts exactly. &nbsp;ZH taught me that if you don't physically hold it, you don't own it nor can you protect it. &nbsp;The dangerous assumption in dealing with BTC is of stability and technology. &nbsp;If things become less stable or completely unravel, good luck getting access to it or kiss it goodbye. &nbsp;If the power grid is down/unrealiable, the internet is kill switched or the TPTB see it as a threat they will do all in their power to crush it, and then, poof it's gone. &nbsp;Maybe it's a great insurance to add to planning, but I would not put all my eggs in one basket. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>So we have one of the main bitcoin guys going through the CIA's front company In-Q-Tel to talk about bitcoin within days of it flash crashing to ZERO with no buyers. You know the&nbsp; Bitcoin is now officially been co-opted by the CIA. Also you guys have no idea who this Satoshi even is. Please explain the first flash crash which was said to have been hacked and this last flash crash of almost 25% of its worth was due to overload or some problem within the system itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO with knowing all of these things how in God's name can you put your faith into something with absolutely zero intrinsic value that obviously has serious concerns with it's stability. I want something that people can touch and know has real wealth and protects purchasing power.... Silver and Gold have 5,000 years of history backing them as real money not currency. Like one other person said when this collapse happens and the digital illusory wealth in back accounts and bitcoins dissapears you will need hard assets. That is the paradigm shift happening is that we want competing currencies and that could be bitcoin but to trust anything that has all the problems and holes in it's function seems a bit retarded. Most of the people on here supporting bitcoin have to try to talk over everyone and become militant about its function as a decentralized currency. The precious metals folks have thousands of years of history on our side and a product that doesn't need a power source, USB drive, passwords, internet connections just to buy an apple at a market or a chicken off a farm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade in my worthless silver??? LOL !! Seriously I Have no problem with people owning bit coins. Good luck is all I can say you are playing with fire. These people telling you that bit coins are the new hit wealth preserver and that you can make all this money by doing absolutely nothing sounds just like people trying to tell you to get into the stock market right now at all time highs. I'm sorry I will stick with whats real:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Thanks for that...and thats fine.</p>
<p>I believe what myself and others are saying is, we just don't want people to get hurt financially.&nbsp;When a currency&nbsp;implodes, the lights go out because workers at the power plant and communications providers (and taxis drivers and ships captains bus drivers, you name it) won't accept that currency for their labor.</p>
<p>No power, no communications, no internet, no <strong>access</strong> to money. You better have something tangible&nbsp;in your pocket to trade for.</p>

    <p>All you need to preserve the bitcoins you hold is the private key - which is about 36 upper and lowercase letters and numbers.</p>
<p>It can be printed on paper. It can also be hammered into a small metal sheet with letter and number punches. That sheet will last years on a sunken ship until recovered!</p>
<p>Then the private key can be entered into a website with a bitcoin wallet, presto, your hoard of bitcoins can be used immediately to buy goods or exchange for fiat$ (if you still want that stuff by then).</p>

    <p><em> store their money thousands of miles from where they live?  Doesn't seem very practical if the SHTF.</em></p>
<p>Depends on the amount of money. If you have more assets than you'd need to live on, storing it in a safer place makes sense.</p>

    <p>Why do these Agora newsletter writers and Doug Casey and the others always go on and on about ***king Argentina?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The horribly corrupt Argentines have turned a geographic paradise into hell like the LibTurds did to Calliefornia.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Peronists have been running the country into the ground for 60+ years.</p>
<p>Christiana Kirschner and the resat of the Peronistas should be hanging from lamp posts.&nbsp; This evil bitch is like Pelosi with slightly less botox.</p>
<p>They are corrupt and lazy like the greeks.&nbsp; Most South Americans hate these snobs who have pawned all their belongings as they have been robbed by the PEronistas.</p>

    <p>That's right. So you've established trust with some tangible (maybe precious metals such as gold and/or silver) and intangible (paper, your own knowledge, etc.) assets. And those all require you to figure out some technicalities for you to gain trust in them, for example with gold you need to understand why it is rare and very hard to counterfeit (and obviously you need to trust your sources), you need to trust your scale for giving you the right weight, etc. Once you figure those details you can be confident that trusting a piece of gold is as good as trusting yourself. If you ever get fooled, it would be your own fault. If you try to do the same with e.g. the US dollar, you will probably find that it is essentially impossible to establish long term trust with a crucial entity, namely the FED (although it might be OK for a little while). Now think about it - it would probably be useful to you to have what Bitcoin  promises to you, only if you can indeed be sure that it works as promised. See  what it promises: worldwide transactions with no third parties. If you try to establish trust with Bitcoin, as with the other things you already trust, you need to figure out some technicalities in the beginning. Find a trusted authority on payment systems and currencies (mind you, bitcoins are <strong>not money </strong>by some definitions, e.g. Austrian school, but they are a <strong>currency</strong>. Bitcoin is also a secure payment system for the currency units called bitcoins.). Find a trusted authority on computers that has an opinion about it. Find a trusted authority on cryptography that has an opinion about it. See what they think and/or dig deeper yourself if you like. At worst, you will have wasted some time only to find out that yet another thing can't be trusted. However, this new thing called Bitcoin might just turn out to be something that you can trust and that gives you more freedom.</p>

    <p>It's almost too bad the workshop was sold out in the sentence following it's announcement. Just catch the 2am infomercial for more infomation on this amazing opportunity, and for a limited time he'll throw in your choice of either&nbsp; a Ronco polishing cloth to use on your gold eagles before you wisk them off to locations unknown,.......or for a mere two dollars more a shiny silver spoon to use while indulging in dulce de leche and basking in the sun on your own private beach, (beach, and dulce de leche not included).

    <p>Although I was being facetious, I was thinking that perhaps Simon would be a bit more specific, ergo what particular flavor of of tribal capitalism/socialism was being practiced.&nbsp; I felt his intro, which was an allegory was too brief.&nbsp; But I'm funny that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise although I am highly intrigued by btc, in it's current incarnation it is far too elitist, technologically to reach any form of mass exceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's another form of hedge that although I may hold, I will never trust completely.&nbsp; And the farm will never be bet on it.</p>

    <p>guessing you are a statist at heart? which is ok, I understand that I used to be one myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ponzi scheme &nbsp;stuff is really tired. it makes no sense. maybe its a fraud or an uworkable solution but to claim there is some central person giving new people's money to other people with some fraudulent guarantee of return on investment is simply not true. I have never ever seen one person promoting bitcoin that claims any kind of return on investment and the people I see aren't or dont seem to be buying it so they can get a return although I am sure they are very happy with the return they have got.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words have a meaning try using them, it will make your life better.</p>

    <p>for those versed in bitcoin, trying to figure out downsides and was wondering is there a point where the blockchain gets so big that transactions take an enormous amount of time?</p>

    <p>The mathematical difficulty of processing a block automatically adjusts so it always takes about 10 minutes. Blockchain length should not be a problem, as I understand it. The problem is that the older versions of the software can only process so many transactions in a block, so if there are too many transactions within a 10 minute period, there will be delays. How they sort this out with rolling back to older software then switching to newer versions, I'll wait and see.</p>

    <p>As I understand it, priority for a transaction is based on:</p>
<p>1) the mathematical complexity of the transaction (number of addresses involved)</p>
<p>2) whether you chose to pay a transaction fee</p>
<p>3) how large the transaction fee you paid</p>
<p>The amount of BTC should not matter, just the above three factors. It is interesting that mining pools can choose whether to only process transactions with fees, how much the fee is, and whether to distribute the transaction fee payouts to miners or keep it for themselves.</p>

    <p>If I understand correctly, all Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to every node in the system. So doesn't this mean that the government (or anyone else) could monitor every transaction simply by setting up a Bitcoin node?</p>
<p>Also, since each Bitcoin contains a record of all the transactions it was ever involved in, suppose that I spend a Bitcoin and someone later gets that Bitcoin via a later transaction, wouldn't they have a record of my previous transaction?</p>
<p>Would it be possible for a hacker to bring the system to a halt by broadcasting large numbers of bogus transactions?</p>

    <p>Transactions are public, but ownership of address is mostly private (extremely difficult to prove). You can create as much address as you want (ideally one for every transaction). Have a look at blockchain.info if you want to look at transactions history.</p>
<p>As for broadcasting bogus transaction, the hacker would have to broadcast it to all the nodes to halt the network. Each "attacked" node would immediatly recognize bogus transaction and not broadcast it.</p>

    <p>The coin itself is nebulous.&nbsp; It doesn't exist.&nbsp; When "created" it is just a ledger entry on someone's wallet.&nbsp; No coin has a serial number as you seem to be imagining it.&nbsp; All transactions are recorded in the blockchain, which means wallet to wallet transfers of some amount of bitcoin is recorded.&nbsp; While it would be possible to track how much goes in and out of one wallet, there is no easy way to identify who that wallet belongs to.&nbsp; And you can have pretty much as many wallets as you want to have.&nbsp; So it would not be hard to obfuscate who actually owned any given amount of bitcoins without much effort on the part of the wallet owner, even without resorting to using Tor or other means of IP obfuscation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hacker cannot broadcast large numbers of bogus transactions.&nbsp; There are no bogus transactions.&nbsp; All these miners mining bitcoins are also verifying the integrity of each transaction made.&nbsp; If the majority of them don't agree that a transaction happened, then it won't be added to the blockchain.&nbsp; Thus, an attacker would need to control 51% of the computational power of the blockchain for an extended period to insert bogus transactions.&nbsp; Currently, the network is hashing at 34 Terahashes/s.&nbsp; There isn't a supercomputer in the world that can currently do half that.&nbsp; There are specific machines coming online that can do a whole lot of hashing (and nothing else but bitcoin hashing) that could cause some concern, but the capital investment they've put into it would be counterproductive to them hacking the system.&nbsp; It isn't like people wouldn't know it was happening, it would be fairly obvious.&nbsp; The only thing that would really succeed in doing is taking down the system (and the faith in it).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>What would happen if someone deliberately broadcast huge numbers of valid transactions as fast as his computer would allow? For example, repeatedly transferring a single bitcoin back and forth between a set of valid addresses? There must be some limit to the number of transactions that the system can process per second.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the peers broadcast their IP addresses to everyone, a hacker would know all of the peers at any one time and could send the valid transactions to every peer, perhaps using a network of bots.</p>
<p>Also since the IPs of all of the inputs to the Bitcoin network at any given time are known, a government would only need to monitor those IPs in order to attach an IP address to every transaction. So it easily track Bitcoin flows across IP addresses.</p>

    <p>The valid transaction spamming is basically what SatoshiDice does in a nutshell.&nbsp; Lots of tiny transactions that do kind of clog up the network as they all have to be verified.&nbsp; As the other person that replied to you said, there are ways around it.&nbsp; Some mining group operators choose not to verify those transactions and leave it to other people.&nbsp; Some require a transaction fee (though this isn't required) to process it.&nbsp; Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what happens if people decide not to verify it.&nbsp; I assume it would just not be added to the blockchain for a very long time until some number of mining clients actually verified the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As is right now, most are completed within 10 minutes when a new block is added to the chain.&nbsp; I'm sure there is plenty of technical discussion of it on the bitcointalk forums.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>..then the value of the bicoins would go up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>thats basically what just happened. &nbsp;the bitcoin reward value had a (scheduled) reduction from $50 to $25 and the value of bicoins went up (to reflect the additional energy required to mine the coins). &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Thx. One can try, can't one ;) ^^</p>
<p>Edit: I still would like to know what the cheapest way is to get your hands onto bitcoins. I bought my first bitcoin from bitonic.nl for about 12 euros when the price was about 9 euros. Still a steal compared to the current price.</p>

    <p>BTW: What do you guys think about Max Keiser's $100,000/ BTC prediction? I think that's highly unlikely. Bitcoin will probably do nicely but if it even goes near that price there will be lots of Bitcoin clones trying to steal its thunder. Remember the software is open source and there are already several Bitcoin clones in existance.</p>

    <p>First, even if there is several bitcoin clones, as long as they are just that - clones - the network effect will make people choose one and stick with it. Especially since it's about money, the incentives are stronger.</p>
<p>Second, pulling a number without proper argument is silly. You shouldn't trust it if there is no real rationalization behind it. But actually, Keiser is just relaying the figure annonced by Rick Falkvinge, the founder of swedish Pirate Party in his blog : <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2013/03/06/the-target-value-for-bitcoin-is-not-some-50-or-100-it-is-100000-to-1000000/" rel="nofollow">http://falkvinge.net/2013/03/06/the-target-value-for-bitcoin-is-not-some-50-or-100-it-is-100000-to-1000000/</a></p>
<p>I do think that his arguments make sense, so we might see that price if bitcoin succeed. Anyway, I'll do fine even if it's orders of magnitude wrong.</p>

    <p>Ok... you have heard Simon's take on the situation in South America after visiting Argentina for a day.&nbsp; I live in Argentina... here is my experience the past 3 days here...</p>
<p>I just finished hosting some visitors from the United States and they are flying out of Cordoba tomorrow.&nbsp; I also just finished meeting with several attorneys and accountants here in Central Argentina, who represent most of the local business community. Now these people aren't international men of mystery, or trust-fund brats, but they all agree on several points.&nbsp; There is a substantial amount of new construction, much of it privately financed with capital (not new government housing for government employees or with bank credit).</p>
<p>Land is cheap and plentiful and many people from Buenos Aires are moving into the center of the country.&nbsp; Some industries are growing at a rather rapid clip: shoe manufacturing, for example, e-commerce, and many of the transportation businesses: especially the buslines.&nbsp; Hardly the financial disaster that Simon describes... but good... I hope all the international jet-setters stay the hell out of here with their funny money fresh from Bernanke's printing press.</p>
<p>Nearly everything, with the exception of electronics, that one finds in the stores is produced in Argentina and should the international financial system collapse, I sure like Argentina's chances better than countries that depend heavily upon imports or exports.</p>
<p>Simon Black and many other doctrinaire types seem to want to have it both ways.&nbsp; They believe that the international financial system is defunct and collapsing, but then they insist that a country, such as Argentina, that is trying to chart a course independent of this system is a fascist dictatorship.</p>
<p>The question is far more complicated than one of "freedom" as if it were a Yang worship word.&nbsp; To open the borders of a country to the "free" exchange of currency by definition opens the country to dollar / euro based international debt financial system-- to hotflows of newly printed Bernanke dollars and Draghi Euros... to the export of Euro / U.S. and Japanese inflation.</p>
<p>Very few people in Argentina are international men of mystery like Simon Black or Multi-millionaire international investors.&nbsp; I am terribly sorry that, the policies of Argentina restrict your ability to move your capital into and out of this country, buying all the land and everything else in this beautiful country.</p>
<p>I'll stay right here in Argentina, Simon, and take my chances.&nbsp; We will see how Chile fairs with all of its freedom and all of its hot-flows of Bernanke bucks when the international financial system collapses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I am not.&nbsp; My previous posts on the subject present a more nuanced point-of-view.&nbsp; I do not agree with many of the things the Kirchners have done.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I strongly believe the government must spend less (free college with a stipend for everyone is too much, for example) and have fewer employees (there are simply an outrageous number of police in the country).&nbsp; This is the only solution to the problem of inflation here.</p>
<p>However, let us not lose the forest for the trees.&nbsp; Argentina had the option in 2001-2002 to go the Greek / Europe / U.S. route or to default... As one politician put it at the time, "We had the choice to save the banks or save the people... we chose to save the people."&nbsp; The decision was made, and it was a bold decision, to cut ties with the international financial system and try to go it alone in Argentina with only limited ties to the international system.&nbsp; The Kirchners could have reversed this course at any time and it is quite likely hot-flows of USD and Euros would have flowed into the country anew (because Argentina tends to have a romantic appeal to foreigners-- I know, because I fell for it).&nbsp; This would have a created a short-term euphoria... a hot-money high, probably followed by another crash.&nbsp; The Kirchners decided to continue following the harder road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We will all see someday soon whether this was the wise policy or no... Whatever one thinks of the decision to limit ties to the U.S. / international financial system, the decision was made with knowledge and forethought as to the possible consequences of both paths.&nbsp; This was not simply a decision about whether to "oppress" people or not... it was a decision about whether or not to subject Argentina de nuevo to the vagaries of international-finance and dollar-based debt or try to keep this system at arms-length.</p>

    <p>i understand what you are saying.</p>
<p>however, whenever a group of individuals claiming to be the "government" tries to enforce some centrally planned notion of how the economy "ought" to be, that is oppression of the people.</p>
<p>let people decide for themselves what is money, and what is its value.</p>

    <p>It's just one exchange, and a very illiquid one. Crazy arbitrage opportunity if you're able to buy some at that price.</p>
<p>Have a look at this page to see all exchange, ordered by volume : <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/" rel="nofollow">http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/</a></p>
<p>As I type, price in euro is 36.7€ on the most liquid exchange (mtGox)</p>

    <p>Back to "normal" again, I guess.</p>
<p>It all seems kinda sketchy - no id, no real location, nothing - if some commerce suddenly offered you gold at a fraction of price, what's the odds you'd get shafted?</p>

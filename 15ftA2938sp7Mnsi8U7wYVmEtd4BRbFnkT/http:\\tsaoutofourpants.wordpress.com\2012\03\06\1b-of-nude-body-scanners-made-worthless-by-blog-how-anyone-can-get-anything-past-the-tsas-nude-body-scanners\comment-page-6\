<p>This video is here to demonstrate that the TSA&#8217;s insistence that the nude body scanner program is effective and necessary is nothing but a fraud, just like their claims that the program is safe (radiation what?) and non-invasive (nude pictures who?).  The scanners are now effectively worthless, as anyone can beat them with virtually no effort.  The TSA has been provided this video in advance of it being made public to give them an opportunity to turn off the scanners and revert to the metal detectors.  I personally believe they now have no choice but to turn them off.</p>
<p>Please share this video with your family, friends, and most importantly, elected officials in federal government.  Make sure they understand that your vote is contingent on them fixing the abuse that 200,000 passengers face from the TSA on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>My legal battle against the TSA&#8217;s nude body scanner and pat-down molestation program continues in court, soon with a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.  If you&#8217;d like to donate to this effort, send PayPal to: jon [at] fourtentech.com</b></p>

<p>Legislators who have stood up to the TSA &#8211; especially Dr. Ron Paul &amp; Sen. Rand Paul</p>
<p>&#8230;and all those who have both publicly and privately stood up to the TSA.</p>
<p><b>Add me on Twitter: @tsaoutourpants</b> (no &#8220;of&#8221;)</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m publishing this video because I want the world to know how much danger the American Transportation Security Administration is putting all us all in with their haste to deploy the expensive, invasive nude body scanner program.  When the machines came out, we were told that the invasion on our privacy, doses of radiation, and trashing of our Constitution were necessary because the old metal detectors weren&#8217;t good enough.  That &#8220;non-metallic explosives&#8221; were a threat, even though no one has boarded a plane in the US with any type of explosive in nearly 40 years.  But while America was testing these devices, Rafi Sela, who ran security for Ben Gurion airport in Israel, which is known for being one of the most secure airports in the world, was quoted saying he could &#8220;overcome the body scanners with enough explosives to take down a Boeing 747,&#8221; and Ben Gurion therefore refused to buy scanners.  The US ignored this warning, and Mr. Sela never publicly explained his statement.  But it stuck with me.</p>
<p>As a scientist, engineer, and frequent traveler, as well as the first person to sue the TSA when they rolled out the scanners as primary in Nov. 2010, I studied and learned about both kinds of scanners currently in use by the TSA.  Here are several images produced by TSA nude body scanners.  You&#8217;ll see that the search victim is drawn with light colors and placed on a black background in both images.  In these samples, the individuals are concealing metallic objects that you can see as a black shape on their light figure.  Again that&#8217;s light figure, black background, and BLACK threat items.  Yes that&#8217;s right, if you have a metallic object on your side, it will be the same color as the background and therefore completely invisible to both visual and automated inspection.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t possibly be that easy to beat the TSA&#8217;s billion dollar fleet of nude body scanners, right?  The TSA can&#8217;t be that stupid, can they?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they can, and they are.  To put it to the test, I bought a sewing kit from the dollar store, broke out my 8th grade home ec skills, and sewed a pocket directly on the side of a shirt.  Then I took a random metallic object, in this case a heavy metal carrying case that would easily alarm any of the &#8220;old&#8221; metal detectors, and walked through a backscatter x-ray at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.  On video, of course.  While I&#8217;m not about to win any videography awards for my hidden camera footage, you can watch as I walk through the security line with the metal object in my new side pocket.  My camera gets placed on the conveyer belt and goes through its own x-ray, and when it comes out, I&#8217;m through, and the object never left my pocket.</p>
<p>Maybe a fluke?  Ok, let&#8217;s try again at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport through one of the TSA&#8217;s newest machines: a millimeter wave scanner with automated threat detection built-in.  With the metallic object in my side pocket, I enter the security line, my device goes through its own x-ray, I pass through, and exit with the object without any complaints from the TSA.</p>
<p>While I carried the metal case empty, by one with mal-intent, it could easily have been filled with razor blades, explosives, or one of Charlie Sheen&#8217;s infamous 7 gram rocks of cocaine.  With a bigger pocket, perhaps sewn on the inside of the shirt, even a firearm could get through.  It&#8217;s important to note that any metal object of any size can use this technique.  &#8230;and I don&#8217;t urge you to try to bring contraband through security, as the nude body scanners often have false positives: so while the metal on your side might get through, a button on your shirt or a sweaty armpit might &#8220;look suspicious&#8221; and earn you a pat down anyway.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure the TSA will accuse me of aiding the terrorists by releasing this video, but it&#8217;s beyond belief that the terrorists haven&#8217;t already figured this out and are already plotting to use this against us.  It&#8217;s also beyond belief that the TSA did not already know everything I just told you, and arrogantly decided to disregard our safety: anything to force Americans to give up our liberty to the federal government and our tax dollars to companies that are in bed with that government.  The nude body scanner program is nothing but a giant fraud, which should come as no surprise after the Fast &amp; Furious scandal that sent thousands of guns to Mexican drug cartels and cost a Customs and Border Patrol agent his life.  THIS is a disgrace.  So let&#8217;s fix this problem &#8212; now &#8212; before the terrorists take this opportunity to hurt us: the TSA must immediately end the nude body scanner program, and return to the tried-and-true metal detectors that actually work, and work without invading our privacy, as well as implement better solutions for non-metallic explosives, such as bomb-sniffing dogs and trace detection machines.</p>
<p>The TSA is worse than ineffective: they are an epic fail placing us all in danger.  Beyond the scanners, Demand of your legislators and presidential candidates that they get rid of this $8B a year waste known as the TSA and privatize airport security.  Ask for their commitment to our rights in exchange for your vote.  And no matter which party is in the White House or holds on to Capital Hill, the issue of ending TSA abuse is of interest to all Americans; it&#8217;s NOT a partisan issue.  We must all stand together and demand an end to the organization that molests our families while placing us in danger by directly ignoring blatant security flaws.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great site. I will continue to opt out of any scanner beyond the traditional metal detector. I&#8217;ve noticed most TSA agents just deal with me without getting huffy these days (it wasn&#8217;t always that way). They seem more embarrassed than me to have to side-hand me in the nether regions so I just watch them. The more people who opt out, the closer we come to getting our rights respected. It turns my stomach to see people all stressed at the checkpoint as they shuffle into the nudie machines. If you told them why they might want to opt out, I imagine most would say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make a fuss or be made to feel like as criminal.&#8221; But that is exactly what they are doing&#8211;allowing themselves to be treated like criminals and not citizens. I am proud to be the one calmly notifying the agent that &#8220;I&#8217;m going to opt out.&#8221; And as I stand there for the 3 minutes it takes them to yell for a female check, I get to see the other folks who are opting out and I feel a certain kinship with them. If any idiot agent starts a schpeel about &#8220;There&#8217;s no radiation, yadda-yadda&#8221; I just smile and look away while I continue to wait. They&#8217;re missing the point, the mindless troglodytes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Someone I know was going through an airport recently and asked to opt-out. When she was waiting in the penalty box for a female TSO, the male started to get cocky and said &#8220;well, if it wasn&#8217;t for the same-sex rule I could take care of you right now&#8221;. It just so happened that the person waiting in the box worked in an executive office of DHS. When she identified this to the cocky male TSO, he became pale and started stuttering trying to find a supervisor. It goes to show you the caliber of idiots that they have at such a helm of responsibility. These half-assed pizza-box employees don&#8217;t take their job either professionally or seriously. They treat it as a 9-to-5 authoritarian rouge where they can harrass the common traveler. In a different situation, the male should have just kept his stupid mouth shut and calmly attended to his job while waiting for a female TSO to oblige with the opt-out search.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am certain that this will fall on deaf ears, but here goes. Do you really feel it necessary to lump all people of a job function into the same group? Of course you do, that&#8217;s why you said it. Have you ever stopped to think that someone has to do that job? If they don&#8217;t, then you won&#8217;t fly.<br />
The people that need to be complained to are not the ones enlisted with enforcing these rules, but the people creating them. If you truly have a problem with airport security, then complain to the right person. Talk to the Federal Security Director of the airport. Tell that person that your complaint is not with the officers, but with the procedures. Make that complaint and go from there. The officers are forced to enforce these rules for a paycheck. Many of them don&#8217;t agree with many of the rules; and they are not all &#8220;mind-less troglodytes&#8221; as many of you think. Also, many of you would be shocked to find out exactly how much money these &#8220;minimum-wage workers&#8221; get paid. The entry-level pay for these officers is better than the entry-level pay for school teachers, police officers, fire fighters and many other public sector jobs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fact is that anyone who has done any research into what happened on 9/11 or who has friends within the military knows that the DHS was planned to be the KGB of America and that what happened here was a COUP not a terrorist attack.  Those who don&#8217;t believe me need to spend a lot more time reading about what happened to the tower rubble, what was found there and the many holes in the stories.  There wasn&#8217;t much difference between 9/11 and the burning of the Reichstag in Germany when Hitler took over except that 9/11 involved a lot more loss of life and several gigantic thefts that were easily covered up during the chaos that ensued.</p>
<p>It is time for the truth to come out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@RB. I like you already. I tend to refer to them as one application away from working the night shift at Taco Bell before the TSA was formed. I can&#8217;t even tell you what I&#8217;d say to one of those dip****s if they gave me any guff. Probably something gentle like &#8220;Watch your mouth, my boyfriend is still in line recording you.&#8221; Or I guess the fact that, in truth, I&#8217;m a writer who strongly opposes their existence should be enough to give them pause. In my heart, I know they are on a slow slippery slope to being unemployed and that their &#8220;power&#8221; is a short-lived mirage. All they can do is say rude things and perhaps stall me so I am late or miss my flight. In the greater scheme of things, I can handle all of that. Especially when I know what I&#8217;m quietly fighting for.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Asktheright: Short answer is hell yes.</p>
<p>Your point about them being the wrong people to complain to is fair enough. They personally have no power to enact change. HOWEVER when they have to report on their traveler interactions, as they will be bound to do, the weasels above them do read that information in the form of data. So an opt-out rate among travelers going from 5 to 10 to 30% is a big screaming red flag to the people in charge. A complaint rate of 10 to 20 to 50% is a big screaming red flag. Then the big cheese has to explain himself to the president. It&#8217;s the same as any business structure. The first grumbles come from the front line. The front line reports back. Management ignores the inconvenient stuff. But when the inconvenient stuff threatens to make their work more difficult, or god forbid, make them look bad personally, then things will change. That&#8217;s how the world works.</p>

<strong><a href="#comment-848" rel="nofollow">Scared of your ignorance</a> :</strong>LOL, your ignorance is amazing. You really believe that the threats that were faced 40 years ago are the same as those faced today? And your saying that a non-metallic non-working bomb is ok? (Shoe Bomber) I personally like to fly on aircraft without any bombs, working or non-working. The simple solution here is that everyone gets a pat-down in addition to the body scan. Don’t want the pat-down, call Greyhound or Amtrak. Stop posing your ill-informed beliefs as fact for fear that someone might believe you!</p></blockquote>
<p>Stop imposing your wish of having a society where the lack of freedom exists and any and all personal rights are taken away in the name of &#8220;security&#8221;. Idiot. He said nothing of the sort that a non-metallic, non-working bomb would be OK. Stop trying to use the shoe bomber as a legitimate example. Why? First, the guy was inept and the &#8220;device&#8221; turned out to be relatively harmless. Second &#8211; and the most important, is that initially the guy was turned away but was later ESCORTED BY SOMEONE AROUND SECURITY in front of several witnesses who testified seeing this occur in hearings later. Why is that not on the front page of news and being investigated? No simple solution, in that everyone getting a pat-down is not in favor of a &#8220;necessary&#8221; search or seizure. And stop the idiot comments about Greyhound or Amtrak &#8211; we&#8217;ve already proven that travel is a right under the Constitution, and your idiot example does nothing for people living on islands.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Are you serious?????? You must be an elitist. People have family and friends spread out throughout the world. I live in Colorado. I have family and friends that I care about deeply in Miami, in the Caribbean, New Jersey, Texas, California, Spain, Germany. Are you saying that I shouldn&#8217;t see my mother ever again? You are clearly for one world government and a master slave world. You think people are not born with rights and that only elitist have rights? the holocaust might have to repeat itself for people to start waking up and fight for their rights unfortunately but even if it comes to that we will get our rights back eventually. The Rothschild, Rockefeller, and JP Morgan families etc&#8230;.and everyone else that supports their agenda in the end WILL NOT WIN THIS. What is going to happen is that history will repeat itself and we will get our rights back. Sadly things will get really bad before it gets better bc so many are in denial of what is happening.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m sorry but I can&#8217;t enlighten you further than your limited intelligence will go!  A pat-down at an airport is not a &#8220;seizure&#8221;!  You walked up to the line and are free to leave at any time so there is no seizure.  PETN and TATP are so far from &#8220;harmless&#8221; I can&#8217;t believe that you would even say anything of the sort.  That just proves your ignorance.  Try google next time before you make an uneducated assumption.  I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of videos too if the words are too complicated for you.  Lastly there is no god given right to travel outside of security parameters.  Despite how many times you idiots say it, it&#8217;s not true.  I dare you to go to the airport, refuse a security check and demand to get on the plane saying its your Constitutional Right!  Just please video it so I can get a good laugh!  One quick question, hows does me asking for proper security to prevent explosives (even those &#8220;harmless&#8221; letter named ones) from being taking onto a plane mean I &#8216;wish of having a society where the lack of freedom exists and any and all personal rights are taken away in the name of “security”.&#8217;  If you knew anything about the Constitution you would know that it is actually the government&#8217;s job to protect us!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and Warrants shall not be issued, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a &#8220;except if you&#8217;re traveling&#8221; or a &#8220;but not if you volunteer&#8221; clause.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to say it&#8217;s you that needs to go back and understand the purpose of the Constitution and its amendments. It is not a document designed to enumerate every right. Those rights are inherent in our being, not given by our government. The government is by the people FOR the people. Rights are specified in order to clarify how the government is limited, not so we the people know our limits.  The government&#8217;s role in protecting us was intended to protect from invasion from foreign governments, not to protect us from each other or from fringe elements.</p>
<p>Freedom of travel was outlined in the Articles of Confederation specifying freedom of unhindered freedom of movement between states. It was thought to be such a fundamental right that it did not need to be specified under the constitution. Since then numerous restrictions on freedom of movement have been tacked on, including passport requirements, &#8220;Free Speech Zones&#8221; and our latest TSA &#8220;safety&#8221; measures. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a seemingly valid reason for infringement of our individual rights. Safety being the most common reason. However one of our founding fathers said it best:<br />
&#8220;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>While people like yourself will point to the volunteer aspect of airport searches you fail to quote the Constitution on this matter or how failing to volunteer for a search restricts travel and restriction of travel restricts commerce and restriction of commerce puts limitations on fundamental pursuits of life, liberty and happiness. i.e. as a business person if I don&#8217;t agree to be searched I cannot freely travel, if I cannot freely travel it becomes a restriction on my ability to conduct commerce. Restricting my ability to conduct commerce effectively robs me of the ability to provide for myself and others under my care.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How the Constitution works:</p>
<p>You have all rights not explicitly ceded to the government.</p>
<p>How the Constitution does not work:</p>
<p>The only rights you have are those explicitly listed.</p>
<p>This is a common misconception in the US.  People think that because we have a Bill of Rights (and some rights in the body of the Constitution itself) that those comprise an exhaustive list of all our rights and other rights, like a right to privacy and a right to travel, don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t how it is.  Our government is intended to be one of enumerated powers, and anything not explicitly granted to the (federal) government is reserved (to the states, or to you as a person).  The government has not been explicitly granted a right to strip-search you if you have the temerity to want to travel using modern technology.  It must justify this through some other means.  It can&#8217;t just claim that there is no Strip Search Clause in the 4th Amendment and therefore it&#8217;s okay.  And it can&#8217;t claim, as you apparently believe, that there is no right to travel, because there is a universe of rights in the structure of the Constitution.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>[3:17] It wasn&#8217;t arrogance that led them to buy these scanners&#8230;somebody made a billion dollars, as you allude to around 3:30.<br />
Anytime you need to know anything about American government, just follow the money. Are they arrogant? Probably. But that&#8217;s not their motivation; their motivation is money. I suppose you could claim it&#8217;s &#8220;power,&#8221; but those two words are virtually synonymous in the United States.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree, follow the money. The documentary &#8220;thrive&#8221; does a good job at following the money and explaining the agenda of these elitists but after a certain point motivation is not money but is power bc if you are the richest family in the world and money and the money you have is still not enough then the agenda is more complicated. The agenda is a master slave world, a one world government or as they nicely want to put it &#8220;a new world order.&#8221; The European union is one of the steps to get there. They also want to collapse the dollar hence why they keep printing money and devaluing the dollar in order to present us with a solution, a new currency. This new currency will unite USA, Mexico and Canada. They want an African union and an Asian union as well. Monsanto seeds creates food dependency, contain poison (soft kill), and eliminates the middle class (farmers whose lands get invaded by these seeds and bc of how the seeds are designed since they are genetically modified once land is invaded with these seeds &#8220;accidentally&#8221; farmers can never go back to growing their own seeds).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve written several letters to my congressional representatives in Washington asking them to stop this madness after I was molested by a TSA agent at the great and hilarious airport in Burbank. I&#8217;ve also detailed on my blog <a href="http://hilarioustravel.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://hilarioustravel.blogspot.com</a> many times at how easy it is to simply avoid this machines by using the highly sophisticated technique of SEEING WHICH LINES THE MACHINES ARE IN and selecting a different line. If you can selectively avoid the new scanners, whats the point? I concur with your thesis statement here and pledge my hilarious support.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This whole scanner thing does smack like a giant waste of money and <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater" rel="nofollow">Security Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ve scanned this page, and the comments earlier when i first read this, and basically the vast majority of these criticisms could be avoided if there was just an added step of telling people to TURN TO THE SIDE while in the machine.</p>
<p>Is this impossible? I haven&#8217;t actually seen the machine (can&#8217;t watch the video at the moment).</p>
<p>Should I become a security consultant and charge millions for this advice?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The point is to not use the scanners, idiot. &#8220;Scan twice&#8221; &#8211; oh, that&#8217;s novel. Expose the people to TWICE the radiation. You should have a job at the top with decisions like that. Great. That will probably be the result. You see, if it doesn&#8217;t take long to think up the solution, then the solution doesn&#8217;t make sense. </p>
<p>How about this &#8211; you use the conventional metal detectors and x-ray technology, and then you also have bomb-sniffers and dogs in the checkpoint area. You know what we had in Iraq? IED dogs. Why? Because you can&#8217;t fool a dog&#8217;s senses. They do it in many other countries, we do it in the US for agriculture purposes. So why are we so worried at someone bringing in a few rings of kielbasa and not worried about someone actually getting on a plane? Go figure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you are so worried about the amount of radiation used in these things you shouldn&#8217;t be flying anyway because you are exposed to more cosmic radiation during a flight than these things use. Slightly paraphrasing here:<br />
       Based on the results of research, the report said, the average passenger walking through a full-body scanner would receive “an effective dose” of about 1.46 microrems, or millionths of a rem, per scan. &#8230; a typical round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles would expose a passenger to about 3 millirems, or thousandaths of a rem.<br />

<strong><a href="#comment-886" rel="nofollow">Asktheright?S</a> :</strong>I am certain that this will fall on deaf ears, but here goes. Do you really feel it necessary to lump all people of a job function into the same group? Of course you do, that’s why you said it. Have you ever stopped to think that someone has to do that job? If they don’t, then you won’t fly.The people that need to be complained to are not the ones enlisted with enforcing these rules, but the people creating them. If you truly have a problem with airport security, then complain to the right person. Talk to the Federal Security Director of the airport. Tell that person that your complaint is not with the officers, but with the procedures. Make that complaint and go from there. The officers are forced to enforce these rules for a paycheck. Many of them don’t agree with many of the rules; and they are not all “mind-less troglodytes” as many of you think. Also, many of you would be shocked to find out exactly how much money these “minimum-wage workers” get paid. The entry-level pay for these officers is better than the entry-level pay for school teachers, police officers, fire fighters and many other public sector jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but this doesn&#8217;t work at all. First, they think that they know more than you do (even if you end up having a much more qualified resume than they do), and Second, they will just through the logic at you that they &#8220;comply with all federal regulations&#8221; blah blah blah. How do I know this? I pointed out a security flaw at the Sears tower with the Security Manager. That was the response that I got. Trust me, their procedures were shoddy at best. They would have people go through metal detectors, but if you ordered a stack of pizzas they would open up the top box and see pepperoni and sausage and slide the stack around the checkpoint (just imagine what you could have had in the boxes underneath). Then they were doing x-ray detection of men&#8217;s satchels or computer bags, but women with hobo purses were not getting scanned. Last time I checked, you can fit weapons inside a hobo purse just as easily as inside a satchel or computer bag. But the only response was that they are &#8220;complying with all required federal regulations&#8221;. Right. </p>
<p>Security managers don&#8217;t want to hear any suggestions. They want you to be a good little sheep and go through their established procedures because &#8220;they&#8221; know best. Some of us have a lot more on our resume and could offer up some suggestions, but &#8211; like you said &#8211; it &#8220;falls on deaf ears.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My point is that blaming/punishing the TSO/screeners/agents is not effective. Why? Because they don&#8217;t make the rules. Calling them stupid or nazis or perverts is pointless. Someone is going to screen you when you fly. Under the current model, privatization is idiotic.Why? Because absolutely NOTHING changes. What you end up with is a private screening force doing the EXACT same thing as their TSA counterparts, AND TSA oversees it, they are still in charge. Look up SPP on the TSA website. That is the only way airports can utilize private companies, which means you&#8217;ve only changed how the TSOs get paid. Nothing else changes.The rules stay the same and the screening procedures stay the same. What people fail to realize is that the rules are not different from one airport to another, the difference is whether those same rules are enforced.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Blaming them is highly effective. They can choose to push back and not conform to groping genitals, patting down young children, treating disabled or elderly inhumanely, the list goes on and on. Instead, it is a focal point for the perverse, the criminal, and the authoritarian to get a job and wear the uniform to carry out their secret fantasies. Privitization works when you force the airlines/airports to fund the security (which, in turn, would be reflected through ridership), and privitization provides a mean to lash back with lawsuits, if necessary. It provides a system of checks, instead of the &#8220;untouchable&#8221; that exists right now. You don&#8217;t get it &#8211; with privitization, we want to ELIMINATE the TSA altogether &#8211; they have 65,000 employees (with 3,986 HQ personnel and 9,656 administrative staff) along with their procured contracts that total a rate of more than $17,500 per hire (and more employees have left TSA than are currently employed at the agency), and their failure to carry out agency operations. And more than 25,000 security breaches have occurred at US airports in the last decade DESPITE the TSA.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In its November report Congress criticized TSA for not being a &#8220;lean&#8221; organization with &#8220;effective&#8221; security.  That same report criticized the &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; security screening and stated that TSA has become a &#8220;bloated&#8221; &#8220;human resources&#8221; agency (i.e., job creator of the last resort), when passenger volume has increased only some 12% within the past decade while TSA staff increased nearly 400%.  </p>
<p>TSA turnover is very high, which is probably a good indicator that at least some of the employees don&#8217;t want to be the target of criticism and/or are disgusted with their job function.  So yes, criticism is effective.  One former TSA agent decided he hit the disgust level and quit and now writes about it and literally performs about it.  Why did he quit?  Besides the utter stupidity of the job, one of the triggers was when he went for scanner training and he was asked to be the &#8220;guinea pig&#8221; while the others practiced scanning him.  He refused.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t get Congress to do our bidding and rethink transportation security.  But we CAN fight the government by tying up its resources and rendering them ineffective.  If criticizing employees makes them reluctant to do what they do for a paycheck, that&#8217;s one more weapon we have.</p>

<p>I disagree. In addition to it being fun, they need to know that we know they are twats, and that their polyester uniforms and twinkly Barney Fife badges are costumes and nothing more. I take it you are a TSA agent, or have one in your family. My condolences.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Awesome piece!  I salute you for bringing this to public attention, as well as to that of the TSA. That being said: &#8220;On December 22, 2001, Richard Reid, also known as the Shoe Bomber, attempted to destroy American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris, France to Miami, Florida, in-flight by detonating explosives hidden in his shoes.&#8221;  This is less than 40 years ago, although &#8211; granted &#8211; it occurred on a flight originating outside the US.</p>

<p>You are nothing more than one of the pied piper idiots that continue to try to spout off &#8220;if you don&#8217;t like it or are worried about it&#8221;&#8230; blah blah blah. Radiation is not about the exposure, it is about the cumulative effect, idiot. Yes, you get exposure when you fly on an overseas flight. But there is proof coming out that these machines can do harm as well &#8211; from expert doctors, mind you. We don&#8217;t need the technology when there are plenty of ways to effectively carry out security checks. But no matter &#8211; NYPD is now working on a hand-held system with Terrahertz Imaging Detection that they will be able to just point at anyone and click away. So much for civil rights.</p>

Though from what I see from where I stand, I&#8217;m not so sure&#8230; Because money is kind of just a means to power, a facilitator, if you will, and has been so for very long now&#8230;<br />
My point is: Both things have been culturaly merged into one same abstract concept that resembles a feeling of &#8220;need&#8221;, which greed/vanity/lust and the rest of them &#8220;deadly sins&#8221; will ever tempt humans into satisfying&#8230; So I would phrase it as follows:</p>
<p>TL;DR &#8211; money has been a facilitator of power for so long now, that while one consciously believes that what they seek is money, unconsciously they are seeking the power that this money will endow them with&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is by far the most asinine comment I&#8217;ve read thus far.  How about &#8220;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety&#8221;.  Or what about &#8220;I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, but I think Jefferson and Franklin are a bit more qualified to talk on liberty than yourself.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that this sheep mentality is exactly what&#8217;s dragging this nation to it&#8217;s knees.  &#8220;Protect me, Mr &#8216;Official&#8217; sir!  The cave men are out to get me!&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Being an old guy, I have learned the full-body scanners are very good at detecting incontinence pads. I got suspected when I went through a scanner at the Dayton airport and got the full pat-down. The TSA personnel were scrupulously correct in their treatment, but it was nevertheless humiliating. It&#8217;s bad enough having an incontinence problem without being put through a full search because of it.</p>

No one, not one innocent traveler, ever deserves to be inspected and prodded and humiliated and abused in the manner that TSA apparently considers routine.

<p>You do realize that you cited case law on five cases that were ruled on between 1823 and 1870&#8242;s  well before air travel.  These cases pertain to people being allowed to transit between states without legal restrictions i.e. passports, taxes, ect.  There is nothing relating to people being allowed to refuse security checks and still travel.  The airlines are private corporations and can set any rules they like.  You can start and airline and say that everyone on your plane must fly without shoes.  If someone doesn&#8217;t like it, they can find another airline.  Airlines turn many people away everyday and there is no legal recourse.  RB, do us all a favor and burn you cracker jack law degree and stick to tasks requiring limited intelligence.</p>

They have replaced the black background images with &#8220;standard&#8221; images of people, it no longer shows the outline of your body.  this guy was probably right in his thinking months ago, but get with the program people.  some dude on a blog is not mightier than the nObama administration</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wrong.</p>
<p>While the image displayed has changed, the basic technology behind it has not.</p>
<p>Imaging equipment does not display what it cannot &#8220;see&#8221;. The color of the background is irrelevant. He went through the machines with the new body outline, which you would have picked up on had you actually watched, and understood, the video. The body outline you think has &#8220;fixed&#8221; this problem? It actually created it.</p>
<p>Try again.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So the lesson is *not* all the gibberish you spew about ending the TSA and throwing away their investment in this equipment.  The lesson is that the TSA needs to spend an extra 20 seconds to scan each person a second time, having the person rotate 90 degrees between the two scans.  There ya go &#8211; problem solved.  Thanks and buh-buy</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just you wait and see whether TSA changes its scanning methods.  What you&#8217;ve failed to realize is that TSA doesn&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about your safety.  The scanners are a payoff to Michael Chertoff and a host of other profiteering villains.  Jon is just pointing out what a monumental fraud has been foisted on an uncritical public.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Most curious about this is that the second scanner he went through was an L3 Millimeter wave scanner which rotates around the body and should have shown the metal box. But nothing showed up! Not a beep! A metal detector would have got that straight away!</p>
<p>And for those on these discussion board who claim that the scanners are capable of detecting plastic explosives, <a href="http://scrapthescanners.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/liquid-explosives-and-the-scanners/" rel="nofollow">http://scrapthescanners.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/liquid-explosives-and-the-scanners/</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This technique does not work on the spiral scan machines.<br />
But why should it matter if I bring a gun aboard an aircraft as long as I do not use it illegally?</p>
<p>Airplanes used to be a damn good time of smoking and drinking and partying. Now they are an anal retentive rule riddled nightmare where the whole trip you are stewing about some pervert placing their hands on you to the point where, if you were not before, you are now mad enough to want to blow up the damned airliner. Just let people bring their own booze, smoke and get stoned on airplanes again. Fuck the squares, let us party.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You people are funny as hell! I keep on seeing you people mentioning Abdulmutallab (underwear bomber) and Richard Reid (shoe bomber). No, really! You make me laugh. </p>
<p>FYI<br />
1) Both Reid and Abdulmutallab had already been identified by international intelligence services, such as the FBI, CIA and MI6 BEFORE THEY BOARDED THEIR PLANES! They were even on No-Fly lists! Ha ha!</p>
<p>2) Abdulmutallab decided to fly through Schiphol (Amsterdam) which was, at the time, THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WITH A FULL SET OF PERMANENT L3 SCANNERS, yet he was not detected&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;so, what was the point of the scanners again?</p>

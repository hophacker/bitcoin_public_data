things you will need at minimum;1 - 6/6.5 gallon bucket with lid with gromet2 - airlock (3 piece)3 - star san sanitiser4 - enough bottles for 5gallon batch5 - bottle caps6 - bottle capper7 - bucket with spigot for filling bottleseg: this from NB. http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/starter-kits/basic-starter-kit.htmland I'd throw in some star san too.then get yourself a recipe kit like this http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/the-innkeeper-limited-edition-extract-kit-1.html (Innkeeper is an awesome beer!)follow directions in recipe kit.give yourself a good half a day. say, start saturday morning as the first time will take you quite some time and be quite messy and take lots of cleaning up note, you will need to be able to boil about 3 gallons AT ROLLING BOIL (so a 4 gallon pot at minimum).this is easy with a propane burner and large pot. if you dont have a propane burner you can try it on your stove top but beware glasstops with the weight of 3+gallons (and the size of the pot), etc.in a pinch, find a turkey frier on special and season the shit outta the alu pot.walmart used to sell an 18qt (4.5gallon) enamel canning pot but I dont know if they do anymore.read this, how to brew 1st edition (free online).http://www.howtobrew.com/intro.html

i've only been following this thread casually for a few pages now, so sorry if this has been brought up before, but do any of you slant yeasts/brett/etc? how many slants do you keep going at a time if so? is it even remotely difficult? this interests me as much as making the beer itself, plus my wife is into microbiology and will totally share some of her camera money for microscopes, vials, agar, pipettes, Erlenmeyer flasks, etc etc. she even suggested using the spare bedroom as a culture room*... anyway, do you guys get into that part? do you trade yeast slants? how do you feel about culturing a commercial yeast strain and then trading it with other people?in other news, i should be mixing up a 2.5 gallon batch of cider/apfelwein this weekend. can't wait to do some real beer.*i fucking love my wife.

I started a batch on Wednesday with an ale extract kit from northern brewer and just tasted a hydrometer sample. It tastes like beer! Flat, but like beer! I was really worried when I screwed up mixing the batch because I was scared to pour in too much of the sludge at the bottom of my kettle. When the OG reading was pretty off (because I didn't dump enough wort and already filled it to 5 gallons...doh) I dumped some more of the settled wort in and got it at least closer to what the OG was supposed to be. It was supposed to be 1045 and I got it to 1040 at least (it was probably poorly mixed). Since this is supposed to be a beach beer I'm not overly concerned about it being too low. It does taste pretty weak right now though and I can barely notice any alcohol in it. Think that will be a problem?The reading I just took was 1.10 so I'm guessing its almost done fermenting? I'll leave it in the primary for at least another week to condition. The krausen (sp?) seemed to be retreating but since its in a bucket this was the first time I saw it. The airlock has definitely subsided its bubbling considerably.

Dogmeat, give it another week or so, but don't worry about being off a few points on your OG. You're close enough.As long as you've done all your sterilization properly, you'll definitely get beer out of it. Most likely it'll be good! (hey, I've only had a few batches that I've dumped)

I'd leave it in the bucket until saturday then bottle it that morning. the less you take the lid off to take a reading the less chance of infection getting in. When you take your final reading make sure the bottling sugar is mixed in well first! boil some water, add in 2/3rd cup dextrose and nuke it in the microwave till its all dissolved, pour in bottling bucket, rack beer from primary into bottling bucket, swish it around to mix it, bottle! make sure you steralise your bottles, and put your caps into a bowl of starsan.

First 3 batches are dwindling and I really need to make another batch (or 3) to make sure it's ready by the time the rest are gone.Here's my question, I have a few kits here and I'm not sure which one to do first. I've got a Russian Imperial Stout, Belgian Tripel and an IPA. So far I've made a Double IPA, Porter and Hefeweizen. I'm thinking of adding some bourbon at the bottling stage for the Russian since I've had some homebrew with that before and it was amazing.So, what say the masses?

I've helped my friend with this when he owned his own brewery, so am familiar with the process, but for me it's just not worth it over the cost of buying straight up. It's only five bucks for a 24 leadup to brewing, vs < $1 but several days of pre-prep. As to strain trading, I'm not aware of anyone locally doing that, but I'm not super connected to the local homebrew scene.

First beer brewed, fermented and bottled!Bottling is definitely the step I hate the most. Knocked my final gravity sample over and broke my hydrometer when I was starting to siphon (never got the reading), got a bit of trub in my bottling bucket because I was dumb with the autosiphon, accidentally stopped the siphon twice and had to restart it, probably introduced way too much oxygen in the way of bubbles because of that, and spilled too much beer when bottling requiring me to rinse and dry them once they were done.My reward is 43 12-ounce and 4 grolsch bottles of (hopefully) delicious beer! The sample I tried was pretty tasty.

I feel bad for all I drank before it was ready but I am really looking forward to the next kit I brew. Since the beer is actually good all the work doesn't feel like a waste and I'm sure the second batch will be much easier. There is still a bit of a "soapy" taste if you sip it. If you take a good swig though it isn't noticeable.

It's easier to get consistent carbonation and there's minimal risk of exploding bottles. Even if you normally bottle everything, it's occasionally handy to be able to serve directly out of the keg for large gatherings.

Last week, I stumbled across the AZ state fair website competitions page, and found they had a competition for homebrew! So after about an hour deliberating and looking at a calendar (and about $150 in ingredients and shipping from Austin Homebrew) I set to brewing up a batch of my two personal favorite beers for judging:-Hellfire Porter: A robust porter with dark cocoa and a mix of ancho and serrano peppers-Succubus Dunkenweizen: A caramelly sweet wheat beer with a mix of light and dark cherriesI also have a fairly experimental batch of applewine I may enter in as well, depending on how it turns out.

Noooo!!!!!The mash water contains the largest portion of converted sugars...about 60-70% of your gravity comes from them.

When sparring all grain, the amount of sparge water is going to be limited by your boil kettle and/or the amount of time you wish to spend boiling the collected wort down to terminal volume. Since your recipe indicates that you're expected to collect more than 5 gallons, you will just end up short on your initial gravity.

sounds like your doing a full boil which needs like 7-8 gallons pot so you can boil 6.5/7 gallons down to 5.your going to be well below gravity and taste.

Been ordered by my wife to make a xmas beer to give away, which is sweet. Got my recipe sorted. 12ish lbs of grain, 3.25oz of hops. picked my yeast, which I'm going to have to make a 2liter starter for. 3 weeks in the primary. 4 weeks in the secondary then 4 weeks bottle conditioning minimum.probably going to skip the secondary and leave it on the yeast cake in the primary for 6-8 weeks and bottle.

Hi all,I've brewed before, back in college, but then fell out of it when I moved to Japan in the 90s. I've been assigned to Nigeria for the next couple of years and decided to get back into it, big time. I've brought a full all grain kit with me and about 500 lbs of grains. I have a couple of kits that I'll run first to reorient myself to the process and establish good sanitation procedures. My two, well, three challenges here are temperature, water quality, and infrastructure. The infrastructure hopefully will be able to sort out quickly. I need to get my propane burners hooked up, my hoses hooked up, and hopefully will be able to my pump for transferring between mash tun and boil pot. I literally got my kit delivered yesterday with the rest of my goods so I'm still sorting through all of my personal items but hope to brew next weekend. I'm just introducing myself to this thread and getting it lodged in "My Threads". I'll be updating y'all later when I get started.I do have one question for now though. Generally we are advised not to drink Nigerian water to avoid gastrointestinal distress. However, since everything gets boiled for an hour as part of the process, I don't have to worry about that, right? Thanks!

jumping into all grain is a big leap! Boiling the nigerian water should kill off the nasties but be liberal with your star san for sanitation. your biggest worry might be, does the water have all the right nutrients for beer?500lbs of grain is a LOT. is it all the same? or did you mix it up with biscuit malt, pilsner, caramel malt, etc?

I do have a distiller but I'm aware of the problems with using that in all-grain brewing. I have two different base grains (5 50lb bags) then a variety of others: Biscuit, Munich, Chocolate, Carapils, and some Crystal 40 and Crystal 60. I've got two different kinds of yeast and maybe 5 or more kinds of hops. I know I'm pushing the limit on shelf life for some of this stuff but so be it. I won't be mashing for a couple months though. I do have 6 pre assembled kits.

12 lbs of grain, a 2 liter yeast starter and 10 gallons of spring water in the garage ready for brewday tomorrow!10 gallons of water to make 5 gallons of beer 1.25 qts x 12lbs = 3.75 gallons for mash, then sparge at .5 gallon x 12 = 6 gallons.. so 9.75 gallons at the ready! stir plate did not get here in time this week so I'm manually shaking the beaker every few hours to oxygenate the yeast...

So, this reminds me to ask: I normally ferment in 6.5 gallon carboys. Do those of you getting krausen out the airlock use something smaller? I've had perhaps 2 batches ever reach the airlock one wheat, the other a brown using S-04 (Dry English). A typical krausen only uses about 4-5 inches of space.

if you look at my pic you will see mine came out the top because the yeast just started its work I put a new clean airlock in it, because the yeast is pushing out so much CO2, no infection will get in from a quick change. You can always just use a blowoff tube instead of airlock like this99.99% of the time I fermebt in a 6.5 gallon bucket with lid. Sometimes the krausen will come out of the airlock, you never can tell. temp + yeast strain + gravity = ???? so many variables.

I typically only use the 6.5 if the others are all full or I'm doing a really big beer. If I think I'm going to get a really rapid fermentation and the 6.5 is in use I just throw a blow off tube in the top. I bought 8' of 1.5~ OD Vinyl tubing at Lowes years ago and cut it in half. Works pretty perfect run into a bucket of water.

Had a holiday today, so got my Columbus Day brew on. This a new creation for me, a Pumpkin ale based around a Rochefort 8 clone. I roasted and mashed four pie pumpkins, filtered and added to the boil water for the Rochefort clone, and then added 2 tsps of a pie spice mix (equal parts cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves) and 1 tbsp of vanilla bean extract. Fermenting it with London Ale III from Wyeast. I liked the flocculation and attenuation profile for the desired end result, a bit sweet and spicy. Gravity is around 1.086. Once I transfer to secondary I'll check the spice and vanilla flavors and add more if needed.

I got propane but need to get some hose clamps to get it all hooked up. Quick question: I'm running kits for my first batches and they call for boiled water into the fermenter before the wort is made. There's no harm in making wort from the full 6 gallons (roughly) if I've got the space, right?

There's no harm in making wort from the full 6 gallons (roughly) if I've got the space, right?Well, there's very little that will actively harm a brew. In the case of doing a full boil for a kit that calls for a partial, there are three things I can think of that are affected by a thinner boil. In order of descending importance: 1. Increased hop bitterness. Hop utilization is a function of the inverse of boil gravity. The lower the boil gravity, the higher the hop utilization and vice versa. Adding water lower's gravity, so you will end up with a more bitter end result. This is decreasingly important the shorter a hop addition is boiled, so it applies mostly to the 60 minute addition, somewhat to the 30 minute, and barely at all to the 5 minute. You can simply move the bittering addition forward to counteract most of the overbittering.2. Steeping grain tannin extraction. Much like boiled tea, barley husks contain tannin that is released proportionate to temperature and inversely proportional to gravity. This is similar to hop utilization, except it's an entirely undesirable characteristic in beer. Either steep at lower temps, or steep in smaller volume then top off.3. Slightly reduced wort color. This probably matters very little, but again, wort will darken somewhat as an inverse function of boil gravity. Not even worth thinking about, most likely.

Yup that's what's in there. I guess I just didn't notice all the little holes in the cap of the airlock. Now that I think about it, it would make total sense to have a little bit of solution escape with a fermentation this active. That being said I just went to Lowe's and got 10ft of 1/2"ID vinyl tubing, and dropped it in my 5gal bucket of Starsan, just in case I need to make a quick blow-off tube.

Hmm, I was planning to take a break from brewing until it got warm enough to do Saisons and Belgians, but I'm getting the itch. I might try a Spotted Cow clone. Should brew nicely in a coldish basement, and it will be done before I need any of my carboys free.

I finally got around to bottling my last wheat brew; it'd been sitting in primary for about 3.5 weeks. Next up is a marzen lager (my first lager), which I'd been hoping to brew this week but will have to wait until Monday. I'm looking forward to letting it ferment in the basement, which is a pretty consistent 50-55*

Bottling the chocolate cherry stout this weekend, and brewing up a Belgian Wit. Also grabbing an extra 5-gallon better bottle and throw together a quick apfelwein.

Brewing a very non-traditional Barleywine this morning. A friend has a rum barrel from a local distillery he wanted to age in, so figured I'd throw something together this weekend. The recipe is a real hodge-podge of stuff I had available and what I could scavenge locally (Iowa has a dearth of local homebrew shops). That said, what I could procure should get me somewhere close to what I was envisioning for flavor. Looking for a raisiny/chocolate/toffee flavor profile, inspired in part by Sucaba and Old Numbskull, with a bit of a belgian twist.Here's the crack-addled recipe (spoilered for those with delicate sensibilities )
Spoiler: show
Code:Old Hodgepodge - 10 gallon Iowegian Barleywine------------------30 lbs Golden Promise3.3 lbs Golden Pilsen LME3 lbs Golden Pilsen DME3 lbs Extra Light DME3 lbs Special B2 lbs Cara802 lbs Corn Sugar1 lb Chocolate Malt1 lb Maple Syrup2 oz Nugget at 60 minutes of boil8 oz "Raw" (Unprocessed) Cacao powder at flameout8 oz Cacao nibs in SecondaryWhite Labs British Ale and Wyeast English Ale yeasts mixed together in a starterStep mash 45 minutes at 146 then 1 hour at 157. Boil for 2 hoursBeersmith is estimating a OG of 1.143 and 16.3% ABV at 70% efficiency
Finished brewing it, between the cold water, step mash, super slow sparge and doing everything outside on a windy day it took about 10 hours. Refractometer doesn't go high enough! I'm over 30 Brix, which is 1.130, definitely thinking I hit my target though. Now to wait on the yeast and father time.

I think (hope?) I screwed up my Heavy Seas Loose Cannon inspired IPA 2 weeks ago when I let the temperature of the mash get away from me. It jumped up to 180 about 20 minutes into the mash and I couldn't get it down for a long time. I don't have a hydrometer currently so I can't measure gravities, but my Safale 04 yeast didn't do anything, even after repitching. THe yeast is getting 2 years old but the previous batch with the same aged Safale05 burbled like gangbusters. I'm just hoping that I shut down the mash and thus there's no fermentables rather than bad yeast.This last weekend I tried my Arrogant Bastard inspired recipe but got distracted while I was on the phone and weighed out too much grain. I usually go with a 7 gallon mash (that's what's needed to cover the mash tun's built in thermo prior to adding the grain) but thought I'd try a 5 gallon mash this time. the combination of a too much grain (maybe 1 kilogram extra? I'm not sure but it felt like A LOT) resulted in a hugely thick mash. I over-reacted and added a few more gallons of water but then the flow through pump kept stalling out, even if I kept stirring to avoid clogging the false bottom. If I'd had time I'd have dumped it and restarted but there wasn't enough time to reset the equipment and make it to the homebrew tasting we had planned for that evening. So now I'm all paranoid about my beer making. I've only got about 6 or 7 weekends of brewing left before I have to pack up my kit to prepare to move to the next post. Most of that I won't even get to drink and will have to leave to friends as I move on. Since Iv'e got a year of language training before getting to the next post, I won't see my gear for a loooong time. kmeeks

Jumping above 170 for even a few minutes halts the enzyme activity necessary to convert the starch in the barley into soluble sugar. Rising quickly during the initial mash cycle is the worst time for that to happen, as you don't allow any time for the sugar to be produced. John Palmer covers the saccharification stage really well here http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter14-5.html At 180 your grain was essentially toast and all you were extracting were tannins from the husk. There might be some sugar in it, but it's not going to taste good. I would dump that batch and not be concerned about the yeast. Dry yeast can last A LONG TIME. I wouldn't even blink at using a 2 year old package. The mash temps though, were I you, I'd have started adding ice the moment I broke 160. If I hadn't noticed and was 20 minutes in and at 180 I'd have dumped it and called it a day.The below table is from the start of Chapter 14 on mashing, but shows the temperature ranges for the various enzymes in barley, and what they accomplish.
Spoiler: show
Code:Enzyme OptimumTemperatureRange Working pH Range FunctionPhytase 86-126°F 5.0-5.5 Lowers the mash pH. No longer used.Debranching (var.) 95-113°F 5.0-5.8 Solubilization of starches.Beta Glucanase 95-113°F 4.5-5.5 Best gum breaking rest.Peptidase 113-131°F 4.6-5.3 Produces Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN).Protease 113-131°F 4.6-5.3 Breaks up large proteins that form haze.Beta Amylase 131-150°F 5.0-5.5 Produces maltose.Alpha Amylase 154-162°F 5.3-5.7 Produces a variety of sugars, including maltose.
The second batch with the stuck mash, you're probably fine though maybe on the low end of efficiency. You really want to keep above 1.25 qts water/lb grain, for sugar extraction and for flow on mash out. My above massive barley wine was right on 1.33 (a pretty common suggested happy medium). You don't mention your grain bill, but 20 quarts of water would be a max of about 16lbs of grain. Most of the suggested recipes I'm reading for Arrogant clones are in the 14-15lb range, so if you overshot the high end by 2.2 lbs you'd definitely have a thicker than suggested mash but nothing insanely over the top. Adding more water probably didn't hurt anything, so long as the temperature of the added water was on the money with your mash temps.Everyone makes mistakes, I wouldn't stress them. The Loose Cannon is probably a lost cause, but the Arrogant should be fine (though probably not going to be spot on for what you were going for).

Thanks for feedback. If nothing else its reassuring that I got the answer right. for the AB, the added water was NOT at mash temps but brought the mash right into Protein Rest stages (which I understand aren't necessary but not a bad thing either). But after repeated problems with the flow, I began to fear that I'd somehow clogged the false bottom or somehow jarred the outpout spigot loose. I didn't know how much extra grain I'd added, but it did over flow the 5 gallon pain bucket I grind into. It was probably a kilo at most, but I was demoralized and not ready to futz with the flow. I would have tossed that and restarted but it was too late in the day so I just tossed it. Will take another stab at it Saturday.

I got around to the Oktoberfest lager a couple of days ago. it did not go great: -The wort came to a boil while I was away from the stove, probably for about 5 minutes before I added the bittering hopes (Mt Hood). -The wort didn't sustain a boil (probably dropped to about 195-200* for ~10 minutes before I brought it back up). -I forgot to put in the aroma hops until after I'd taken it off of the boil and topped it up. I let the fermentation go for a couple of days in the house (approx 65*), then moved it to the basement yesterday. It had developed a nice krausen. I plan to give it a couple of weeks there, then bring it back to the main area and let it come back above 60 for the diacetyl rest. Then rack it into a Better Bottle for a long sleep. I need to get my ass in gear and find a chest freezer; for some reason I'd thought that the 50* temps in the basement would be okay but I guess I was wrong based on some recent reading.-----------------------------I've been kicking around the idea of building an arduino-based controller/monitoring tool. I've got some rough ideas for functionality: -monitor ambient temperature (outside fermentation chamber)-monitor beer temperature-monitor temperature in fermentation chamber (not strictly necessary)-turn compressor on/off as necessary (I'd need to add an external contactor to handle the current)-log all information to a network-accessible log file (.csv or text) -display current conditions on a local LCDI'd also really love it to have the ability to monitor specific gravity, but I'm not sure what type of sensor would be required - maybe something optical?

I find this hooked to a chest freezer makes a dandy lagering chamber. The temperature of the beer will equalize to the temperature of the freezer so there's not a really a need to measure the beer directly.

Anyone care to help me out here?I've been fly sparging since the mid 1980's. You don't need $250 worth of kit to do it The upper tank holds the sparge water - mine is a white plastic bucket with a hole drilled in the side at the bottom and a piece of tube JAMMED in it (the hole is about 1/8th inch smaller than the outside diameter of the tube). I wrap this bucket with an old fleece shirt and some towels for insulation. I found a couple of tiny C clamps that look like this at my hardware store:I eye-ball the flow rate - you'll get it pretty quickly. You measure the time to can fill a quart jar and make adjustments. The only rule of thumb I have to pass on is that you want to keep a pool of sparge water covering your grain bed until the end. Put a T on the end of the tube that inlets into the top of your mash tun and thats it. I have well under $20 into it - its lasted me about 15 years so far.

Efficiency is typically in the 75-80% range so I've never felt any need to increase the complexity by recirculating the wort.There are people in this world that recirculate until the wort runs clear (sparkling clear) - this is overdoing it. You want to reduce the amount of grain husks and trub getting into the brew kettle. If you recirc about 3 pint glasses you will get ~85% of it - including a few large chunks. On the other hand if this step seems unrelaxed and worried to you take GohanIYIan's advice and just skip it. You'll probably never know - it makes more of a difference in a commercial size kettle. This is one of those things that the big guys do that homebrewers just copy. They do it to reduce the size of the pile of gunk in the bottom of the brew kettle and reduce the amount of Irish moss they have to add (in addition to reducing the amount of tannins dissolved in the beer).

Anyone care to help me out here?I batch sparge with essentially that exact set-up. Efficiency is typically in the 75-80% range so I've never felt any need to increase the complexity by recirculating the wort.There are people in this world that recirculate until the wort runs clear (sparkling clear) - this is overdoing it. You want to reduce the amount of grain husks and trub getting into the brew kettle. If you recirc about 3 pint glasses you will get ~85% of it - including a few large chunks. On the other hand if this step seems unrelaxed and worried to you take GohanIYIan's advice and just skip it. You'll probably never know - it makes more of a difference in a commercial size kettle.

They do it to reduce the size of the pile of gunk in the bottom of the brew kettle and reduce the amount of Irish moss they have to add (in addition to reducing the amount of tannins dissolved in the beer).So if I were to batch sparge, say for a 10 gallon boil, I would split the 10 gallons into equal five gallons batches? First at 165F, put into the lauter tun, let it sit for an hour, vorloff, drain to the hot liquor tank, and then do the other 5 gallons of water to say, 173-174F and hold that for 10, then drain again to the hot liquor tank?

why split it into 2x5gallon? just do a 10 gallon boil. hot water in one, mash the other, sparge into the pot and boil away.buy 20 gallons of water. mash as much as needed, boil up 10 and fill the top cooler. once mash time is up, sparge from that through the mash and into the kettle. do it all in one go. no need to split into 2 x 5gal batches.if you have a 10gal boil, that is a lot to boil off if your going for a 5 gal target batch (common size).

aslo with tha NB kit, the only good thing is the false bottom, its fantastic. the rest you can build yourself for 1/2 the cost. lowes often sell those coolers on discount for like $30 walmart too. the fittings are $10-$15 at lowes.

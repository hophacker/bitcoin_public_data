Nope, Minecraft works fine through a NAT device. There is no peer to peer between players, it's all peer to server. I second the suggestion of deleting every single JRE on your system and installing a fresh one. Wait, are you on a Mac?

Does this happen to anyone else?I've built a Nether Portal and when I travel through to the Nether I have two Nether Portals there with only one being active. It look like a frame (obsisian) around the active portal frame?Bug?When I go back to the Overworld I only have a single portal. I've never built one in the Nether... just the one in the Overworld.

Well, updating Java seems to have fixed my FTB problems, which is weird because I previously played on that map on the same Java version. The performance is terrible though, and I'm pretty sure worse than the last time I played. Top out at 30 FPS where I get 200 FPS in vanilla Minecraft. jediatzinger: That's not common, but I've had it happen (other way around, extra overworld portals). I think it just forgets there is a portal for a minute sometimes. Who knows. Hey, free obsidian!

I've never built one in the Nether... just the one in the Overworld.That's happened on the older Tekkit server. We had other issues with crisscrossed portals, but this issue also cropped up.What you'll want to do is hard wire the nether and overworld portals to each other. Write down the coords for the overworld portal and divide the longitudes and lattitudes by 8, keep the height number as is. Those mathed out coords are your hardwire Nether coords. In the Nether, build a new nether portal at that exact spot, then ignite it. You can now safely remove the older nether portals, and no new ones should be created on their own ever.

With FTB it's even easier than that. The minimap automatically converts nether coords to overworld coords, so you just have to match up the coords exactly.

I should point out that only VoxelMaps (formerly Zan's Minimap) does that; its not in every FTB pack. Mindcrack and Ultimate, I believe, are the only ones with it right now.

I need some help here guys... ever since the update, my game has been crashing a LOT. Usually it's when I'm opening a chest or my inventory, occasionally it's when I use a linking book. I don't exactly have a powerhouse of a gaming machine - it's a Macbook Air - but I never had these problems before. Below is what the console read when things started going coocoo. OS X, Java, and Minecraft are all up to date. In vanilla, the title screen confirms I have 1.5.1, but in the FTB title screen it still says 1.4.7.Help?

Couple of quickies:1) FTB is still running on 1.4.7, and it downloads its own Minecraft jar in the folder it's working from Your 1.5.1 version is totally separate from FTB, unless you have been manually updating it. If so, delete the appropriate FTB folder (Direwolf, Mindcrack, etc) and tell the launcher to force an update so it redownloads everything fresh.2) Looking at your crash screen, the first line is saying that java ran out of memory, so you might want to go into the settings for FTB and increase the amount of ram it allocates. I believe I have mine set to start with 1.5GB and it tends to use up almost 1.2GB when its done loading. (There is a way to see how much memory a program is using in OSX, but I use Win7 so you'll have to google it)If its still crashing after that, you'll probably need to remove and reinstall java, cause sometimes the updates dont always clean up older versions very well.

I can't see that error screen, but I used to get GL out of memory errors all the time even though I had the FTB slider all the way up at 1gb. Then I dialed it back to 512MB and the errors went away. With F3 mode running I see that it generally stays in the 300-400MB range, and you can really see every time the Java garbage collector runs.

Now that we've beaten Gregtech, I was looking around for something else that looked fun, and saw PaulSoaresJr posted a video about the Legend of Notch mod. Might try messing around with it this weekend, hoping that I can get it working on a server. If I do, anyone feel like they'd want to join in?

With the MindCrack server kind of feeling done at this point, would people be interested in a much more loosely setup FTB Ultimate server instead? Easy recipes, access to everything in FTB Ultimate, and I'll probably bring over the ops list from Direwolf. The intention with the Ultimate server would be to run for a good long time to encourage people to work on megaprojects. I might even see if I could get worldedit working on it.

The joys of java memory tuning. Perm Gen is where the JVM stores the classes and related data it loads. This is separate from the main memory heaps. I don't have much experience tuning it, but this thread might have some options you can try: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8823 ... pace-error.

That is expected since my machine is running 32bit Windows. I built it back in times long ago when 64 bit drivers were buggy and/or nonexistent. Actually, most of that hardware still doesn't have 64 bit drivers, but it is sitting on the shelf now. Anyway, Mindcrack has been perfectly happy with just 512MB of memory surprisingly enough, even with our very busy workshop.

Wow. Alvaries produce a ton of stuff. With my apiaries I could manually process the products but now that I have bees to produce lead, copper, iron, pollen, royally jelly, and of course honey that means thousands of combs a day to be processed. I think I'm going to download DW20's latest world and take a look at his setup. Might have to go back and watch the video GenerikB did too on his setup again too. I wish they'd put a torrent of their map up for people to download.Also anyone having problems with extra drones and alvaries make sure you're using an apiarist's pipe to put them back in. If you setup the pipe like I mentioned before it works fine with both alvaries and apiaries.

Still, I've learned a lot from it and wouldn't mind a map reset if it meant I could play with other people and get them to show me a few things. It'd also be fun to explore a new map.

I don't know about everyone else, but I tend to have the most fun in the first few dozen hours when you're just getting things set up and working your way up the tech tree. So all the map resets make me happy. However it seems like we keep losing one or two more people after each map reset, what sort of things would make you want to play more?How about a mod that started everyone a few thousand blocks away from each other? Or playing on a sky-island type of terrain? Going back to a bukkit server and adding some RPG mods? Loading up a RPG map and playing in adventure mode? Anyone else have some ideas that they want to do?(OT, but anyone interested in an iPhone4? I'm upgrading mine next week, and dont have a need for it)

Woot. Managed to get Tarnished and somehow Galvanized bees tonight. I've also found that if you can get a hybrid of the bee you want and mate it with a hive bee that doesn't make a mutation with it you can get a pair pretty easily. After you get a bunch of drones you can get a species serum and go to town making a super bee if you want to use it to produce items for you.FWIW if I was playing on a server that reset the map that often I'd leave too. The server I'm on now has had the same map since 1.0 and we're all still very happy with it.

The BigDino server is running on the same map for a long time as well (i think it goes back to the beta days). However it seems that almost noone has been playing on it for many many months (ever since we re-started the last tekkit map last fall). I just hope that we as a community aren't dying out.

For what it's worth, I consider the MindCrack map to have been more in the spirit of Mindcrack, as an actual community challenge map. Also, I was curious what a the end game looked like when people had to think of something other than solar, but really we were midly EU starved for pretty much the entire runtime. Like them or not, the game is balanced against high power solars these days.

Thought I's share my boiler setup since you all inspired me on the last page with the talk of your boiler setup. I play on a friends private server but have played on the Tekkit server previously.Initially I was using the same kind of water setup VintageBeef uses in his LP, but found that all of the buckets on a fast clock cause a lot of client lag, so I started looking into alternatives. Primarily I wanted something that was AFK or as close to it as possible, but not solar. Solar is boring as shit to me.At any rate, many lack luster forays into biomass > MJ > Lava led me to conclude that that was way less AFK than I was willing to run. But boilers with reed input like you guys run? Totally perpetual. The only input is fertilizer, and that is only every 8 days using my napkin math.I went with 36LP Liquid fueled because of this analysis. TL;DR is MJ/HU being equal, you'd have to stretch the graph out to infinity for the the HP boilers to start reaching efficiency parity due to massive warmup costs. And even if it was not like that, I like that turning one off will be less painful (170 buckets of Biofuel to warmup 1 36LP boiler).The fuel supply is bog standard 2 layer 21x21 reed farms using the "Tetris L-Block" layout for the water.I setup 2 boilers 3 blocks apart and run 5 liquiducts from each to a bank of 9 Industrial Steam Engines (1 block of Liquiduct can supply 80 steam which is enough for 2 engines at the max rated 8 MJ/t). The engines face the center block between both boiler elements, and feed a redstone conduit line. Each pair throws out 144 MJ/t, and I am completing my second pair.What the hell do I do with all that power?9 MJ/t is bled off the trunk with a Redstone Energy Cell used as a choke (9 in/9 out), and powers the 2 Sugarcane harvesters. 30 MJ/t gets used for the fermenter and 3 stills. And 200 MJ/t is bled off for a row of Magma Crucible/Igneous Extruder pairs. The remainder feeds an energy cell which outputs to the rest of the base, when I have occasion to need mechanical power for something.The lava that is produced goes into a 7 block cubed tank, which is pumped out to 21 Thermal Generators, which can supply 504 EU/t to my EU net and MFSUs as needed. When demand is low, I pipe it to 2 Industrial Centrifuges, and make Cheaty McGee copper and tin. Obviously the plan is to use some of that power for a Mat Fab, but that is still in the works.I have found that 4 layers of cane farm can still be handled by one full power fermenter. I use Gold OR, and Autarchic GOLD OR gates to supply fertilizer to the fermenter. I'll automate this later.I can screenshot some of this crap if anyone wants to see it.

The downside of using LP boilers is you need twice as many of them, and they are quite bulky. HP is less efficient when warming up, but once it is running it's all the same. The other downside of HP boilers is that they need steel, but you need steel for the liquid fueled firebox anyway, so it's not a huge leap to get a bit more steel for the boiler itself. As far as watering a boiler, a single TE Aqueaus Accumulator can feed a huge number of boilers without breaking a sweat. I don't even know how many you can supply, but we are running 5 boilers off of a single accumulator on the Mindcrack server. Seriously, whenever I find a machine that needs water to run, the Aqua Accumulator is my first and usually last stop. They're pretty cheap and easy to build and so easy to install and use that no other water system in the game even comes close. You would be surprised how quickly you can burn up all of that power. Quarries can suck down 75Mj/t when you're running the power through tessaracts for instance. The Assembly table is an enormous energy hog, and since everything on it takes forever to run it can easily cause power dips in your base. I didn't bother with piping the steam to the Industrial Steam Engines, I just attached the engines directly to the side of the boiler and ran Redstone conduit up the corners. This simplifies the wiring since there is only one type of wire going around the base instead of two. The setup is quite easy as well. You just attach Industrial Steam engines to each corner and run the Conduit between them. Levers are stuck to the middle boiler blocks between the Steam Engines to start them up. It's a very elegant configuration. a 3x3 layer of HP boilers can support 4.5 Industrial Steam Engines, although I typically only install 4 and have one overflow steam pipe going into a liquid tessaract to power small engines elsewhere. The advantage of piping steam is that it is not lossy like energy tessaracts. The disadvantage is that if you need large amounts of power then setting up all of the steam engines on the remote side is a hassle, and you run into the limit on how much steam a pipe can carry pretty quickly. So I tend to just attach hobbyist or commercial steam engines to the tessaract for remote farms or other low power projects. Are you as annoyed as I am at how impossible it is to make a Fermenter look neat and tidy? With 4 inputs and 1 output, the thing is just doomed to be a mass of pipes and tubes. I generally go with 1 Fermenter for every 2 layers of max size reed farm (21x21), this is more than you technically need, but it allows me to toss in saplings or plantballs or whatever for a little extra biofuel when I feel like it. I've found that three Stills per Fermenter is a good ratio as well, although you may need more if you have 4 layers of reed farm going into a single Fermenter.

The efficiency is not the same after warmup that's the thing. You have to factor in that fuel cost and normalize it over time. The graphs from that analysis make it pretty clear that that is a long way out for HPs. As for bulk, I have 4 turtles going nonstop excavating for resources, I have a MASSIVE basement to put a power plant in. I see both your points, I just have specific requirements for my setup, and small is not one of them. As I implied above, I don't use quarries. They are to slow for me. I use turtles fo lyfe. I make all this MJ for purposes of converting Biofuel to EU at close to 200k EU / 1000 mb.On the subject of pipe mess; I think I have a still and fermenter setup that I am happy with now. The whole thing takes up 3 wide, 4 long, 2 high. This includes a gold chest for fertilizer. I don't bother with a buffer chest for the reeds, at 3 layers current, I get no where near accumulating reeds in the fermenter at max speed. In fact it is empty more often than not. I have also never witnessed more than 1000 mb of biomass in any of the 3 stills at any time. So I think 1 fermenter, 3 stills per 2 farms is a pretty good ratio.I'll do a pictorial later. I know I like to see peoples crazy projects, and this can be classified as crazy. Shiftless79

I think QC and I ended up putting an AA under each boiler because something went horribly wrong with the liquiducts when we I nstalled the fifth boiler. We kept losing water every tick from all the boilers. Even whenwe added two extra AA's in line with the first. In the end it was just easier as AA's are dirt cheap.For stupidfast mining you Should check out DW20's new mining frame. It is... Crazu in its simplicity.

That's what I do, I have one AA under the 3 blocks between the 2 boilers sitting in a 3x3 pool; for each pair of boilers. Then I just have the liquiduct poking out of a hole and running to each. No problems thus far. But now I am paranoid. I'm playing on hardmode Mindcrack. Are these frames only in Direwolf?

You don't need a 3x3 pool for a AA. It literally only needs 2 water source blocks touching any two of the 4 side faces and it will produce 1 bucket of water every 2 seconds forever. If you want to see the stills start to back up, toss a few stacks of saplings in the fermenter. Saplings provide a crazy large amount of biogas for reasons that only Sengir knows. In fact on the next map we're going to experiment with a multifarm set up in tree farm mode to see just how much biogas it can supply.It's probably worthwhile to think about how you're going to handle the day when the old school forestry farms are removed, because the new ones are wicked expensive and not nearly as good. I'm thinking a reed harvesting turtle wouldn't be hard to program, but is probably less efficient than the current reed farmer. Maybe a Steve's Carts wheat farm for biomass? You could probably make a fairly efficient wheat farm setup using old school water gates for harvesting, some BC pipes to collect the material, and a turtle to replant the seeds afterward. It's really easy to make huge farms with water harvesting. All you have to do is figure out how often to harvest and how you are going to replant the seeds.Frames are a RedPower2 thing, but I have to warn you that they have a reputation for corrupting worlds and interacting badly with other mods. If you're playing on a server with other people I would discourage their use. Also, backup any world before you start playing with them on single player, just in case.

Yeah It seems like everything in FTB is Solar Solar Solar. I fucking hate solar. And now it's not even an option really if you use Greg's because anything over lol-voltage requires iridium, which if you had, would mean you would not need the expensive solars anymore.There is always bees for iridium I guess, but you know that is getting nerfed to shit eventually. It HAS to.

We did a lot of non-solar work on the Mindcrack server. IC2s nuke plants for instance are surprisingly easy to build, although very copper heavy and I finally got a configuration that produced reasonable amounts of power without requiring enormous quantities of uranium. You can check out the rod configuration on the Mindcrack server if you're curious. It does require Gregtech though, since Thorium rods are crucial to the design, and reloading the reactor automatically was annoyingly difficult, I had to build two factorization routers, plus a Retriever and a Transposer to make it work, as well as Factorization barrels. I could have done it with a factorization router in place of the Retriever if you don't want to have to mess with blutricity, but the transposer was actually important to the design because the Uranium rod loader has to be slower than the Thorium rod loader for the setup to work. Also, Greg requires boat loads of Iridium long long before he makes his matter fab practical. It's "balance". Igneous Extruder->Magma Crucible->Gregtech Thermal Gens were a workhorse as well. I never got the Netherrack autoloader to work properly, but even so they provided most of the power for the base for the duration of the Mindcrack run. I didn't try the big wind or hydro farm this time, the workshop seemed laggy enough as it was, although I'm still a bit dubious on the complaints that small gens cause lag anyway. Plus, Greg made the basic gens so freaking expensive that they really don't make sense anyway. We pumped out a LOT of nether lava to run Thermal Gens too. We were entirely unkind to the Nether on Mindcrack. There was also some experimentation with refining oil using the BC Refinery and using that to drive Gregtech Diesel gens. That worked, but oil is a lot more scarce than lava and they just don't supply enough energy for the amount of effort involved. Even if you include an oil sands/oil rock refining chain (fairly easy to setup, but you have to build IC2 machines which Greg makes expensive) the oil just does not go very far. Actually, refining the rock/sand oil is a waste of time, they just aren't common enough for the amount of work you have to put into it and the amount of oil you get out of it. I was seriously disappointed in how little fuel each block of oil eventually became. Oil Geysers are a much better source, but they only hold a few hundred buckets each typically and the Diesel Gens blow through that in no time. The best use of oil is just as "water" for the Nether, if you want to turn lava into obsidian or make Blaze spawners safer.

Everything in FTB is "solar solar solar" because solar works, and it doesn't require tons of manual attention or some ridiculous automation setup to maintain.Minecraft shouldn't be a full-time job. I already have one of those, and I get paid for it.

I have two 3 chamber thorium setups ready to deploy for the Mat fab plant, I think they put out 104 EU/t each or something, but my setup uses quad cells. With infinite copper it's not to bad. It's just outstripped by the boiler setup. I guess I don't see why farms need a nerf. The whole thing took like 5 days to setup, not to mention more iron, steel, and hardened glass than I care to mention. It should be powerful for that cost!

It seems to me that we would be better served by Advanced Hybrid Water or Wind gens. I don't know why Solar get singled out as the endgame renewable so much. The basic solar panel isn't nearly as abusive as the advanced ones, simply because they take up so much space and require so much tin wire that ridiculous huge deployments become self limiting. Having to install a 32x16 array is a lot more work than plopping down one Ultimate Hybrid panel. Really, the high power solar panels don't make any more sense than a high power wind or water either. You can't make a super powerful real life solar panel by stacking 512 panels on top of one another. You're ultimately limited by the amount of total energy in the sunbeam and the size of your panel.

24 Thorium per run is going to eat into your reserves pretty quickly if you're running 24/7. You can make Thorium from Coal, but it is like a stack and a half of coal per rod or so. I might consider trying to find a more balanced reactor design that uses Uranium as well just to get more juice out of it. Our Mindcrack reactor uses two quad thorium rods and eight single uranium rods (which have to be replaced 4x as often as the Thorium rods). This is great because when you fuge uranium dust you get 16 uranium rods and IIRC 4 thorium rods per cycle, plus a Plutonium rod. You can also fuge depleted uranium rods for more thorium rods if you don't want to mess with breeder reactors. Even with two full speed Quarries running almost nonstop, that fairly modest 230EU/t reactor was burning up uranium faster than the quarries could replenish it. We were lucky that I waited a long time to build it so we could start off with a huge stockpile of uranium. IMHO, IC2 could easily double the runtime on the Uranium rods without unbalacing them. Forms of energy generation I considered but never implemented: Tree farm attached to a furnace that pumps out charcoal into simple IC2 generators. The downside is that IC2 gens output a pathetic 10EU/t trickle of power, so you would need a ton of them, and the total efficiency isn't great because the conversion process from logs to charcoal is kind of expensive and Charcoal doesn't burn terribly long. It might be more efficient to put the charcoal in Forestry's hobby steam engines and use that to drive a magma crucible converting Netherrack into lava to pipe into a Gregtech Thermal gen, but the breathtaking complexity of that setup is its own problem. The only reason this might work is because forestry for some reason gives you a lot more power per chunk of charcoal than most mods. If you really wanted to make it complicated you could run that coal through a Coke oven first to give it a longer burn time, and use the Creosote to run a semifluid gen for a little extra power.

Yeah, I saw them interviewing a relatively on CNN yesterday. They might have put the headline like "Boston Bombing Amputee Jokes 'I No Longer Fear Shin Splints'", but it's a true story.

It was intended to go into "Pictures that did not actually made you LOL **may contain some NSFW content" I disagree, this is the pictures that actually made you LOL, not pictures that are guaranteed to make everyone else LOL.Ok, I literally looked for a funny pic for about 20 minutes, and didn't find any that actually made me LOL, so just text, no pic from me. Also, being at work hampers this.

this weekend will mark 4 weeks of sitting in primary. should be nice and robust! long primaries rock. need to find time to bottle it tho.. so it may end up going 5 weeks in primary.@nutrimentia, as pysguard says if your kit calls for a 3 gallon boil and you go to a 6, you'll end up with a very hop bitter brew, hops love water, so if you give them that extra water, they will increase their bitterness.

Be careful with doing a full boil batch; if it is a 5 gallon kit and you have a 6 gallon kettle, the chance of a boilover occurring goes up significantly. I don't plan to start doing full-batch boils until have a 8-gallon or larger kettle.This is based on what I've read so any real-world experience would be appreciated here.The wife and I bottled 2 batches this weekend--a Northern Brewer kit called Caribou Slobber which is a English style session ale. We also bottled a smoked porter. Both were fermented using White Labs WLP006. The Caribou Slobberis going to be quite tasty; I can't wait until these brew are bottle conditioned.I am still trying to figure out how I want t do a pumpkin ale this year; I like te iea of using a Belgian style ale as a base.

I made a chocolate milk stout over the weekend. Oddly enough I hit my FG perfectly, but was missing about half a gallon of beer.I guess that's what I get for using some old 2 row and eyeballing the recipe.But oooh is it fermenting happily.

I posted this image to g+ last night, the layers of sediment are pumpkin on the bottom and I think the yeast starter in the upper ring.A lot of people just go for a sweet and pie flavor spiced attempt, I've always thought though that the pumpkin needs to be there. I think the best pumpkin beer is probably Southern Tier's Pumking, and they definitely use pumpkin (it's listed as an ingredient on the bottle), and it's a big sweet beer so I followed that idea. I used four 5-6lb pie pumpkins, quartered each and roasted at 250 for about 2 hours with a brown sugar simple syrup drizzled over the flesh, mashed the flesh up, then added to 2 gallons of water at 170 and steeped for about 45 minutes. Then strained out through a colander, and ran the remaining flesh through my juicer (what a disaster/mess) and then added all that into my boil water. This morning after settling down I've still got a good five inches of loose sediment in the bottom of the carboy. I'll probably gelatin spike it when I transfer to secondary, and then maybe again before bottling to try and bring down the sediment and limit the loss of beer.Of course you could go full on ridiculous and just use a pumpkin as your fermenter. http://www.byo.com/stories/article/indi ... -last-call

My friend and I have two carboys of cider bubbling along; one with ale yeast, one wine yeast. We make it from scratch, buying cull apples from a local orchard and extracting the juice with an ancient wine press. Our experiments over the years have yielded various results. Champagne yeast resulted in a dry but too sour drink. Half pear with lots of honey was too sweet for me, but my wife liked it.

My 15 gallon pots aren't in any danger of boiling over yet, methinks. Thanks for the feedback. Still have a week or so to decide whether to follow the recipe or risk bitterness. Will keep you posted.

I then went into another room for 5-10 mins looking for some random object. When I came out, she'd just finished the entire bottle (750 mL wine bottle).It's since become a staple brew at my place.

got my 1st xmas batch bottled last night, phew, that's nearly 5 weeks in the primary, and just in time to brew xmas batch #2 this weekend. bottle condition batch #1 until xmas and its gold. batch #2 will primary for about 4 weeks and bottle condition for 2-3 weeks and bring me right up to xmas. then my wife can hand them all out to her list of people needing homebrew.not sure I have enough propane left tho to do a full 8 gallon sparge and one hour boil.

I made a pumpkin saison that did really well. The funky flavors it emitted almost mimicked the pumpkin pie flavors. Got a runner-up prize for it, IIRC.

So I'm going through my kit and realized that I've got some parts that I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do with.....I know its kind of small but hopefully you can tell what everything is. 5 and 6 are a pair, I believe, with 5 having two females and 6 having two male ends. 8 and 10 are the same, one stainless, one brass. 7 is bigger and thicker than 12 but essentially the same. 13 is flat and 4 is labeled "lock nut". The bigger tubing (2) is for pumping the wort into the boiling, I know this. I believe that the little piece of tube (9) is for attaching the bottling syphon to the bottling bucket's valve. Long clear tube (1) is for racking to secondary, I believe.(3) intrigues me. It is much smaller than false bottom for my mash tun, but I'm pretty sure I didn't buy the wrong size. I'm guessing its used in the boil pot, with hops? Not quite sure what its function is, but it does have a tube attachment on top. Help needed here.The real questions are for the red gaskets. I think the ball valve is intended for use as a bleeder on my pump, to ease priming when I'm pumping out of the bottom of the mash tun. My boil pot doesn't have a spigot at the bottom, not a particularly relevant point here, I suppose. I've got a standard March pump and believe that the locking nut, 4, is used to tighten down the connection without the handle ending up in some odd position. The brass nozzle goes on the other end (outflow). 8 fits into 5, which fits on the pump intake, so what is 6 for? And I still don't know where the flat washer and two red gaskets go. Maybe with the lock nut? This isn't the easiest question and the picture isn't the easiest to see, but maybe some of y'all can help me figure this out. Thanks

1) tubing2) moar tubing!3) False bottom or a hop filter for the boil pot, since it doesn't fit in your mash tun, looks like it's #29) EVEN MOAR TUBING!!!as to the red gaskets, I'd bet money they go with the ball valve to seal the connections.

it all looks like false bottom + mash tun cooler conversion kit. short hose goes from your false bottom to the spigot on the inside. #2 goes on #10, #9 connects #3 + #8.white tubing looks like high temp tubing for the outside of the mash tun spigot.#3 is definately for a 10 gallon rubbermaid mash tun conversion.not sure what you mean that you pump from your mashtun.

I forgot that I brought a cooler for mashing as well. It all makes sense now. I am not going to use it initially. I need to get a couple extra parts for my pump in the meantime. Yakumo, after mashing, I'll pump the wort into the boil pot for hops and chilling. My boil pot isn't tapped on the bottom, so it will be harder to recirculate while chilling and to pump into fermentation. I plan just to stir during chilling and then use an auto siphon into fermentation.

made a 2litre starter over the course of 3 days for my brew, pitched a massive yeast cake last night and wow... airlock is like 10 bubbles a second its crazy. never seen anything ferment out as fast as this is going and its only 65F. Using Wyeast American II 1272 to make an american red ale. 13lbs of grain, 1 hour mash, 90 minute boil and will do 1 week of dry hopping and will primary it for about 4 weeks.

So, yeah...Turns out my girlfriend's youngest daughter has been using "the pretty bottles" (my fermenters with holiday brews) as a toy of sorts, depositing change, crayons, and God knows what else for about a week and a half now. One of the unfortunate causalities was my contribution to the "12 beers of Christmas" beer exchange I'm participating in organized on HomeBrewTalk.So I'll be substituting a spiced apfelwein (they were the only two fermenters spared the wrath of a curious 4-year old) instead of the abbey weizen I was planning on.My question is: what kinds of spices would work best? The only one I can think of off the top of my head is cinnamon, which is kinda... dull, TBH. What else can I use?

spiced beer is very... hmmmmm... its hard to get the mix right, often it comes out potent or underwhelming. my neighbor calls them vanilla shakes and refuses any kind of spiced beer.if you want a wintery spiced beer I'd go for something like a mix of apple pie spices. something that might give it more nose than flavour, a lot of spice beer to me comes out kind of medicinal.

Don't know where head has been last couple weeks. Racked my Russian Imperial Stout into the carboy 2 weeks ago for secondary and then promptly forgot about it sitting in kitchen. In regular daylight (no direct sun shining on it, but still...)What did I manage to do here? Should I bother with bottling? Usually my stuff all gets stuck in the nice dark basement until it's ready for the next stage.

Sniff/taste test it. If you detect skunk, it's been struck. If it's struck I wouldn't dump it though, throw some bourbon soaked oak sticks and a couple vanilla beans at it and hide it away for a month or two. You never know how something will mellow out, I've had "mistakes" end up working quite well through neglectaging.

Finally got propane flowing to my burner but something is wrong and it doesn't burn hot enough. I boiled 3 gallons of water for 40 minutes (uncovered) and it barely hit 150 degrees. I don't know if that can support a 15 gallon all-grain wort session, even with a lid. I'll give it another shot tomorrow.

http://bayouclassicdepot.com/sp10_propane_burner.htm 185K BTU. Got it at the brewshop, good wind protection. I think the tank pressure is the problem. I'm headed out to try again. Because the water here is unsanitary, I'm going to go for a full 6 gallon boil rather than dilute the 2.5 gallon wort in the fermenter. I'd have to boil and cool the second batch of water which would add a lot of time and hassle. I'm already pretty paranoid about sanitation here since I've got to work outside during the dusty season.Yakimo, you mentioned risks of bitter beer if I used a large volume of water. Another brewer friend of mine said that the lower volumes in kit instructions are primarily there because most people don't have equipment large enough to handle the full amount. He said it would help with hop utilization as well. I'm going for it this time primarily because of concerns over sanitation: I need to boil the water at least 15 minutes. I'm running it through a good Culligan filter initially but don't want to get giardiasis, you know.

Usually takes around 10 minutes to boil with propane on full dump. I'd guess you've got an issue with the air/gas mix as I've run my tanks completely empty and not had issues maintaining boil. Play with the stainless ring opening at the hose connection to adjust the air mix.

I've had some issues with some of my propane burners and tanks at the regulator. Flushing both directions with compressed air helped a few times, though one time I replaced the jet burner to fix it.

Bumping this to heap some praise on a new (to me) vendor I used for an order yesterday, Rebel Brewer http://www.rebelbrewer.com/. I haven't received my order yet obviously, but after the phone call I just had I'm suitably impressed with their customer service.I had an idea for a beer that started with a spec sheet from Briess on their new seasonal CaraBrown malt. Looking around Rebel seemed to be the only place that carried it, and their pricing was as good/better than Austin/Northern/More on everything else so figured I'd go ahead and place my entire order with them. I was kind of rushing through my order and using the search engine to find what I wanted quickly. My base malt is going to be Maris Otter so placed 10lbs in the cart along with the rest of my order and clicked purchase. I just got off the phone with the guy packing my order. In my haste I'd apparently ordered Crystal Maris Otter, and when he was packaging things up he thought that looked like my intended base malt and that it looked like a really odd choice so called me to make sure that's what I wanted. I was pretty shocked and said that no, I'd actually meant to order the Crisp Maris Otter, and thanked him profusely for noticing my gaffe.Now I don't expect that to happen when ordering on the internet, I clearly wasn't paying enough attention when shopping, but damn color me impressed by the service. Anyways, a bit of a plug and thanks to them I'll be a happier camper on brew day. yakumo

Nice, I had not heard of them. I placed an order last night with NB for a stout recipe that I created. 14 lbs of grain.I went with golden promise as my base malt. throwing in with it some flaked oats, english dark crystal, english black malt, briess carapils, flaked barley. I dont remember my percentages of each off the top of my head.Its not a "real" stout as its bjcp colour srm is waaaaaaay off the charts and its expected ABV is slightly higher than normal. it was interesting to see the same recipe in brewtarget + beersmith2 gave different results on OG/FG/estimated ABV. Probably slight differences in mash calculation but they seem far enough apart for it to be... odd....ohwell. time to get ready to make a yeast starter on thursday.

Those seem close enough to me.

Hello all. I will doing my first home brew next month! Pretty stoked.I am learning from a co-worker of mine and we will be kegging. Since I live in an apartment, I am looking to invest in a mini-fridge or a keezer. I have been leaning toward creating a keezer - I have been studying this guide to check out different sizes. (I only need the GE 5.0 cu. ft)If I went down the keezer road, I would need to buy one of these as well. My question is are these freezers pretty reliable? It can't be good turning a freezer on and off all the time or is it fine? Obviously, people do it but it seems like using a controller like this would cause problems down the road. However, all the mini-fridges that I look at either are way out of my price range or suck at cooling and have terrible reviews so I am trying to see what the norm is in terms of these 2 routes.

I have a Frigidaire freezer and Johnson digital control. I don't use it as a keg fridge anymore (though it's about to become a lager fermentation vessel), but it saw regular life in that role for 4-5 years and hasn't shown any issues with the duty cycle. I generally gave the freezer a 5-6 degree range to live in, so it didn't cycle that frequently that I noticed.One thing that I did which is a little different is built a collar for the top and then mounted the door to the collar. This image shows what I'm talking about http://www.ttbrewing.com/shimgs/right_insde.png Was pretty simple, the inside board is a 1/2x6 and then I based the rest of the measurements around the actual size of the freezer. Doing it this way allowed me to use standard shanks through the collar with the ability to return it back to a freezer if I ever wanted to (which I've done, and now going back to brewing).

Quote:If I went down the keezer road, I would need to buy one of these as well. My question is are these freezers pretty reliable? It can't be good turning a freezer on and off all the time or is it fine?Shouldn't be a problem. . . refrigerators and air conditioners kick their compressors on and off all the time. I could see some argument that the compressor might be built to take fewer cycles since a freezer is less active and should maintain its temperature better, but even in your application you're not going to be kicking it on and off more often - you're just using it to maintain a higher temperature. that said, I've finally gone slightly down this rabbit hole; I picked up the Mr Beer on a whim via Woot the other day and already have the first brew going (the included ingredients for a Pale Ale). I expect to bottle that this Sunday and will plan on starting the next brew with another kit from them (though this one is all malt; I died a little inside when I realized that the 'booster' is mainly corn syrup solids). It's not much, but I think it's a worthy introduction - definitely not a hugely substantial investment, and the space that it takes up in my apartment is negligible.

I have not posted here in a while, but suffice it to say, I'm brewin' again, after taking a year hiatus.Over the next month or so, we're making more upgrades to the brew setup so that we can actually make use of the full 40 gallon capability of our conical fermenter and boiling tun.One major reason we stopped brewing was because with the new equipment, we just couldn't seem to do it right anymore. The yeast wasn't as vibrant in the fermenter, and we were spending a LOT of time in the steps. With the ability to brew in larger batches, all the other equipment we had that was OK for 10 gallon brews was now very obviously deficient for 30 or 40 gallon brews. So, we had to spend some money, and also save up money to spend on other stuff.For example, our biggest hinderance to a good brew has been with getting enough water heated up for sparging quickly. We've got 2 450,000 BTW burners, but we only have 1 40 gallon pot, and it's the one that we steep in. We were using 5 gallon pots and pouring into a 5 gallon bucket. Took WAAAAY too much time.So, we just recently bought 2 more 40 gallon pots (thank goodness they have come down in price, only $125 each), and will be using them for heating water, and as a dedicated steeping tun. Our existing Stainless pot will become our boiling kettle.We had a big issue with pumping enough wort fast enough to reduce contamination, so we bought a new pump that does a MUCH better job. It's not self priming, but it should always be below the level of the wort anyway, so that shouldn't be a big issue. Our brew stand is wood and rickety - so we don't currently have a burner installed to heat water. A coworker of mine is a master welder, and will be building us a new stand for cost of materials, allowing us to have a burner installed purely for heating water. It will also allow us to mount the ChillZilla and pump to the arms so that we can just move the entire stand with minimal assemble and setup.Same thing with hosing. We're converting to quick connect, so that we can quickly sterilize equipment and properly clean it quickly, as well as connect & disconnect to the chillzilla with a minimum of fuss.Since the 40 gallon fermenter is so big, we couldn't use our heating straps on it - they're woefully inadequate. So, we built a dedicated "fermentation chamber" that's reasonably sealed, and put a floor heater in there - allowing the ambient space around the fermenter to be temperature controlled for maintaining a good fermentation temp.Man, it's good to be back brewing. With our small batch gear, we've got 15 gallons of Holiday Ale currently kegged and pressurizing, and we've got 15 gallons of a Belgian Black Ale recipe currently fermenting. In about 2 weeks, we'll be doing another 15 gallon batch of an as-yet-undecided recipe as well.

I remember a friend buying some sort of external foam sprayer system when he bought a house in an area with frequent wildfires. He ended up going with some sort of permanently installed external sprinkler thing, plus adding metal shutters that could be closed and designing the yard like a fire break.I don't think this is what he got, but the fact that this site exists amazes me: http://www.fdnntv.com/Foam-Safe-System

^^Keep in mind, that is dark smoke...which usually means structures are burning. The smoke has since turned white, and is settling downhill, which means really unfavorable winds (blowing it down toward Boulder proper)

Are you in Boulder, Frennzy? I am hearing from people there that they can see the fire too (Sadly I can't see your pictures just now)

Seems like it jumped that ridgeline, and is now consuming the entire back half of the mountain...smoke plume has quadrupled in the last 10 minutes or sohttp://www.9news.com/news/article/27444 ... vacuationsIt's two fires, but they sure look like they've merged from where I'm sitting.

Please fire don't burn Frennzy and leave the Air Force Academy alone because I like that big roachclip statue they got and the tabernacle is pretty sweet.

Three pictures from when we were told to go home this afternoon (~3:30p local), all should be ~640 x 360. I'm not very good at this whole image-attaching thing, so constructive criticism is appreciated I heard from some people on the west side of the building that, much like Frennzy, they saw several lightning strikes behind the mountain and then saw smoke rising. Work smelled delicious when we got kicked out... and if I was a little faster getting to the camera on my phone the first shot would've had a helicopter in it as well.No zoom, I was standing in the driveway of the building when I took this.Surprised when I got home to realize there was a flame in this shot... zoomed in some but still caught the side of the building.I think trees were exploding on the ridge, there was an impressive burst of flame.

If you are in the Springs or Manitou or thereabouts and have to bug out but can't take pets my sister will take em, she is in the south of the springs furthest from the flames. She just rescued a friends cat from the NW springs evac zone. If she had to bug out too, she wouldn't leave any animals behind.

That incident? It's even scarier than that. What they figure happened is that some of the combustible volatiles being driven out of every damn thing anywhere near the fire collected on the slope, and then flashed over. There was a distinct lack of shake n bake bags* on the corpses.*Shelter bags for jumpers, intended for when you're pretty much fucked. Theory is, you get in the bag and let the fire run over you. Sometimes they actually work.Funny looking at those pics. I remember taking pics of a fire that was in the process of fucking off (a highly technical term, indicating a combination of class 5-6 fire behavior, some wind, and fire's complete disregard for the designs of man) and figuring they'd look amazing. Sounded like a couple hundred jet engines, could see huge chunks of flaming tree flying half a kilometer through the air, yadda yadda.Didn't look like much when I got home and developed them. Frennzy's look worse. Fast guess, one of those pics has flames 200 meters high in it, if not more. That's some SERIOUS shit there. The good news is that the tree density in those pics looks lower than what I'm used to, so the fire won't move quite so easily. Then again, "less" is still too much.Frennzy, you got a lot of black pine there?

Jesus Christ, Wingfooted posted while I was typing.The smoke column is flashing. WOW. That looks like the shit we had here (southern BC) in 2003. Fires one ridge over from where I was were in a park, so they let them burn. It rained on and off in Calgary for a week as all the water vapor from combustion nucleated out on the smoke.Keep your ass safe, yeah?

Those Colorado Springs pictures are very . For reference, that is the Air Force Academy stadium in the top pic, and as you can see, it's not very far from a huge-ass inferno. The second one is even worse though; looks like hell on earth. Juxtaposed against the town in the foreground, it's pretty frightening.

I am in Texas, but my sister lives in south downtown colorado springs. Everyone on the north and west parts are having to bug out, either mandatory, or because of the . She said the smoke was very thick and the air nasty hot when she drove out closer to the fire to rescue the cat.Those two pics are each from a different of her local facebook friends.At last report, only 5% containment on that thing too.

Here's a free hint: 5% means there's a wee piece they're pretty sure it can't burn. Because it already burned.I fucking HATE those numbers. It's a fire. It's either knocked down to where 75 guys are coldtrailing it, or it's still a fire.

It had the odd effect of making the Flagstaff fire look much smaller than it was, since the smoke almost completely dissipated -- just a thin gray twisting around was left. Then the winds died for a bit, and I could see the smoke curl over the top of one of the flatirons and just seem to weave through the trees as the darker smoke behind it glowed orange. Made me think "oh shit." My poor state. Rain, please.

Apparently the Flying W Ranch is basically gone, it just now completely burned down. Scanner traffic and their website are confirming it.Also, just now issued mandatory evac for the Academy area.In other nesw, their governor is named "Hickenlooper". That name is awesome.

Crap. Dont have an exact locale though, just west side, and recent. Pretty sure that area was evacuated though.edit - most likely Mountain Shadows community or nearby.

I've been at the Air Force Academy since last week and have various pictures of the smoke since the Waldo Canyon fire started last Saturday. I don't have any good shots of the flames since I was a little busy last night. We moved to Peterson AFB after the evacuation. I live on the south side of the Denver area, so I'm not in danger of losing my house. I just don't know where most of my travel 'stuff' is. The person that cleared my room grabbed my laptop and iPad, and luckily my cell phone charger. In the grand scheme of things, not knowing where my clean clothes are is minor compared to what a lot of people are going through.

The Flagstaff (Boulder) fire must have been knocked down by rain overnight...hardly any smoke today.C-Springs, on the other hand, is getting ravaged.The High Park fire up near Ft Collins is likely destined to burn until fall.

I saw footage last night on the news, and all I could think was, "When did nature decide to turn Colorado into Mordor?"I hope y'all are safe, and that last night's rain really helps put a stop to the burning. I joke, but man, I really can't imagine being a dozen miles from something like that.Mordor, I mean.

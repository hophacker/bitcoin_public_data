I grew accustomed to using Galaxy S 3 this way, and seeing it continue to the Note 2 is definitely welcome. Samsung gets the value of having a consolidated accessory lineup, and the Note 2 continues that by making the flip covers compatible with all the Note 2s the same way the flip covers were interchangeable between international and USA variants of the Galaxy S 3.edit: found them on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_ ... over+note+I've got this one on mine.

Got mine at the AT&T store. The only branding is the tiny AT&T globe on the back.I don't think I will be using the stylus so I must say that I prefer stock Android. The screen is gorgeous and LTE speed when you have good reception is amazing.Will wait on any cases and/or protectors for now until there is a better variety out there.

This might be the only exception I will make to skinning of Android, because genuinely useful extensions were added to the GNII's Android build.I am aware (though "heavily modified," at least at the OS level is a stretch), and yes, the pen stuff is a good value-add. Only the pen stuff. The rest of it is standard "establish the brand" ass-talk that needs to go the hell away. If you make it look (and, at least with touch input, behave) like not-AOSP, it's automatically a failure as far as I'm concerned. Samsung isn't the worst offender by far, but they're still shitty.Personally, any skinning is unacceptable; I took back an Atrix HD because they squared off the corners of my back button and made the home and app-list buttons look stupid. I'm buying Android devices, not Samsung devices. (This is why I have nothing but Nexus stuff.)

Pretty slow going relative to the KeyboardI agree handwriting recognition is a little disappointing- at least so far. In the final Newton MessagePad models, the HWR was excellent (though 'printing' only). My handwriting is so bad that I can barely read it myself sometimes, but the Newton learned it just fine. That's one of the differences- I don't think this version adapts/learns. On the Newton, if it screwed up, you could double-tap on a word, and it would give you some suggestions, and would improve the next time. The other good things it would do is let you could write over recognized text with a number of actions: scribble through a word to delete it, or draw a caret to insert spaces between characters, etc. But I suppose Samsung has enough patent troubles with Apple as it is to add those little touches in. TheVelourFog wrote:So on the iPad there's an app called Notability. You make notes with a pen or finger, drawings, whatever, and it sync directly with DropBox in PDF format. Then you can view them anywhere and have them backed up. Is there an equivalent I can use for the Note 2? Making notes that I can't pull up instantly on any of my other devices is useless to me.S-Notes by default can be "Exported" only as a PDF or JPG. But you can "Share" the same note as PDF/JPG plus Plain Text and S-note file (.snb). I tried sharing one as plane text to Dropbox, and it worked just fine. Why it differentiates that way, I have no idea.The flip cover sounded great when I first read about it in the Anandtech review, but after reading about the version for the Galaxy S III, it doesn't sound that great. The biggest thing is that when the cover is flipped over the back, it covers the camera. The idea of taking pictures with the flap dangling seems pretty ridiculous.

I am due for an upgrade from iPhone 4 in mid January and I think I'm going to go with the Note 2. I mostly use my phone for media consumption and rarely as an actual phone. The screen looks gorgeous and I do think I would love it but I have yet to hold one in my hand.

But if software mode flies along just fine, it shouldn't be too big a deal since that 3,100 mAh battery can probably handle the CPU load for hours before dying.

I don't understand why people buy this product....the Galaxy Note is way too big. Buying a S3 or the Iphone 5 is definitevely a better idea and if you want a tablet....then buy a real one. Not a phone that wants to be one m2c

Everyone like big screen but the problem is this screen is fucking too big for a smartphone. That's not really convenient to bring the phone everywhere with you. I don't want to buy bigger pants with big pockets just for a phone. It must also be impossible to text on the go with only one hand with the device. Definitively a random products from Samsung imo.

Definitively a random products from Samsung imo.Too big is relative for the user. I agree the GN2 stretches the limits a bit, but it would fit inside of the pockets of any of my pants easily (khakis or basketball shorts for the most part) if you wear skinny jeans, or most women's pants, I can see a problem. Samsung did a lot right with the GN2, but IMO where they lost the plot is when they made the screen bigger, but the resolution lower compared to the original Galaxy Note. It's similar to the 17" laptops that comes with 1920x1080 screens, if you're going to offer a device with that form factor, take full advantage of it and offer it with a higher resolution screen. If I can get a 4.7" device with a 1280x768 true LCD (RGB stripe) display compared to a 5.5" device with a 1280x720 pentile display, the smaller screen is still going to be able to show me more information and resolve text in a clearer fashion.

Those are sales numbers before the North American launch, mind you.The original Note sold over 10 million and the Note II is easily going to double those numbers. There's a lot of people out there who want a phone with a bigger screen, and Samsung's random product is going to make them billions. Lucky for me I own some Samsung stock now.

They target a design that will be broadly popular extremely well, but for someone willing to make more than one phone, they can target a number of local maxima even better.

What's your point? If you don't want a Note, then don't buy one. To say its too big to be marketable is clearly wrong.

I just got off the line with Verizon and after getting them to bump my upgrade date a month, I will now be eligible for new phones on Dec 8th. Woohoo! The weird part is that I priced out a completely new plan for the two new phones and the bill would be $40 less monthly than my current plan. 1400 talk minutes, unlimited txt and data currently VS unlimited talk and text, and 4GB of shared data. I fully expected to get shafted out of my unlimited data but the reduction in bill is a nice consolation. Note 2 here I come!

So went by the AT&T store tonight, intending on playing with the Optimus G to see how I liked the screen, and to see how much LG's skin screwed with the interface to help decide if I wanted to go for the Nexus 4 or the Optimus G. As it turns out I may now go a different direction entirely. A few surprises: - The Lumia 920 feels really good, like most expensive and high quality phone that I've touched good. The screen is great, web browsing was smooth, and WP8 is snappy. I surprisingly didn't hate the Windows Phone interface. I'm not sure if I love it or not, it seems awfully busy and a bit non-intuitive, but it might be worth digging into it just to get that phone. - The screen on the Galaxy Note 2 looks better to my eyes than the Optimus G, even though the Optimus G is true RGB stripe and has a higher real resolution and pixel density. Blacks are deeper and colors have much more pop on the GN2. Text was still easily legible, and I didn't notice any fuzziness form the pentile display. - The GN2 feels snappier than the Optimus G. It could be that running Jelly Bean vs ICS has something to do with it, or the software loaded for AT&T store demos is hurting the Optimus G (it crashed twice while I was playing with it) but the GN2 felt quicker, which surprised me because on paper the hardware is older and slower, the Optimus G kills it in all of the benchmarks. - The Optimus G feels cheap and too light. The GN2 feels better, and weightier, but still not as good as the Lumia 920. I feel a bit like a teetotaller after having his first Old Fashioned, who knew a Windows Phone could be that good? I might have to remodel my entire mental space here where it comes to mobile phones. There are still some questions of course, the guy at the AT&T store said the Lumia 920 doesn't support visual voicemail, but a Google search seems to imply otherwise. No visual voicemail would be a dealbreaker, I can't think of a more useful feature for a modern phone. The other major potential issue is Google Voice. I use my phone for business and personal matters, and I prefer to use my dedicated phone number for personal things, and my Google Voice number for business. On the iPhone there is a dedicated Google Voice app, I couldn't find one in the Windows Phone store, anyone know if there is an easy and seamless way to use Google Voice with a dedicated dialer in WP8? If I decide to stick to the Android route, the Note 2 is suddenly the front runner. It already has Jelly Bean, which is good, so even if Samsung drags their feet on OS upgrades, at least I have pretty much the most modern version yet. I know the Optimus G and Nexus 4 have Krait core CPUs while the GN2 is stuck with A9 cores. Looking at benchmarks it seems to do better than the GSIII, but not as well as the Optimus G and Nexus 4. Am I shooting myself in the foot by thinking about buying a phone with an out of date processor? I don't plan on doing any 3D gaming on it, just web browsing, phone use, and general productivity type stuff.Anyway, I know this might be TL:DR, but I'd love to hear some input from anyone who might have feedback about some of this, thanks.

I put it down to two factors: because it's so large, it fills more of the pocket and can't slide or get turned around like a smaller phone can. And while it's also larger, it's not nearly as dense as the iPhone. About 75% the density of the iPhones.

I don't like the pin unlock screen, and the battery life is mediocre. I wish I could have it turn off the cell radio while I am in my work building but keep wifi up. I like android and the screen is still lovely. I have no case on it at all and I'm not sure I want one. Feels so nice in my hand...Are there any docks that put audio out without hooking into the headphone jack?

Okay, I did it. T-mobile's $200 rebate deal got me - with the clock running out last night on their 2-day special, I purchased a Note2, and have a new phone number with a new carrier. I just could not resist any longer!This is the first time I have ever switched carriers - it's been something like 15 years (Houston Cellular, back when it barely had towers outside Harris County. Rebranded themselves to Cingular, ate ATT, rebranded themselves to ATT.)This is my first smartphone (most recent was the Moto Tundra.)This is my first time changing phone numbers.I don't have a tablet.Just a leeeetle bit overwhelmed.Screen protectors? Too many to choose from! Full body wrap? Flappy case? bumper case? metal case? Both case and wrap? Don't want to reduce the screen responsivenes... Firewalls, apps, customzing stuff, migrating contacts...... aaaagh! ...but it's really pretty. Edzo

Had a chance to play around with the ATT version while waiting for the release of the Verizon one.My first impressions are mixed. The overall design is nice, but not spectacular - it (and the GS3) reminds me of the iPhone 3G/3GS design. The screen is beautiful, would be great for watching video on the bus/gym and reading PDFs/Safari Books Online. But I'm not fond of the UI (is it the TouchWiz skin?) - colors, etc.My friend in Korea had a very nice looking UI (she claimed it was from the factory, and she's definitely not the sort of person to do any hacking/mods), definitely nicer looking than what the ATT version is running.Would the Verizon one have basically the same UI skin?In any case, I'll reserve final judgement when I can play with the VZW later this month, but as of now the iPhone5 is back in the running for my next phone.

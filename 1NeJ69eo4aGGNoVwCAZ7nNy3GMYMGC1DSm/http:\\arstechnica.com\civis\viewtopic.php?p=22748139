Had lost almost 25 pounds, and gained about 15 of it back. Yes, it's good that I didn't gain it all back, but I still have about 105 to lose from here if normal weight ranges are to be trusted (we'll see how I look and feel when I get closer... my mom lost a lot of weight once and was within the normal range, and looked absolutely sickly. I'm not looking to do that).I've counted calories every day since Monday and that's been going fine. I did ok with the Couch to 5k sessions this week, too. I just need to stick with it, and it's such a long road ahead of me.

Don't think about the long road. Having a goal in mind is essential (imho as always) but think of it as one day at a time. You don't have to eat right and exercise forever, you've just got to do it for this 24 hour period. Concentrate on 3 things:1. weigh yourself everyday and record it on subtractthefat.com (or your site of choice) This is a good thing because it forces you to be accountable and you can now see trendlines. Also you'll get a feel for what is ok to eat and what isn't. I more frequently have a small serving of chips now because I know it's not a huge deal, whereas I wont' have icecream because I know it is. Also it lets you use that neat feature on the subtractthefat home page that shows your week/month/alltime progress indicators which is very motivational.2. Making the next right decision. Just *this* meal eat the right thing, or have a glass of diet iced tea (or water or whatever) instead of eating and see how you feel in 10 minutes. Use your weaknesses to your advantage. I'm a huge procrastinator and I like to snack when I'm bored, so instead of doing that I simply 'put off' eating for 10 minutes or 20 minutes or whatever and frequently I'll find myself engaged in something else instead. I also drink a ton of flavoured 0 cal/0 carb ice tea / fruit punch drink mixes. I also chew/suck on ice to feed the oral fixation... YMMV. 3. Play the tape all the way through. This means think about the entire lifecycle of what you are about to do. Sure taco bell would have been awesome for lunch today, I love the way it tastes (so sue me) BUT there are lots of ramifications from that: ie.. I'll be gassy during rehearsal / exercising, I'll feel like shit because I always overeat when I go there, I'll feel hungrier tomorrow because I've expanded my stomach, I'll feel like I've let myself down, I'll probably be disgusted with myself because I gorged myself, and finally, because of #1 I'll have to see my weight rise tomorrow. Play the tape all the way through, is Taco Bell worth that? I'll admit occasionally it is (but I do try to moderate myself) but usually it isn't. Also I try to save stuff like that for more special occasions. For example, I'll be in Troy 2 weekends in April and you can sure as hell count on the fact that I'll be hitting up the Ale House and I loves...Edit: more of a personal thing but I couldn't handle counting calories... way to tedious and I eat out way too often (as in I get a salad from the supermarket salad bar every day from lunch) instead I just use my judgement and basically try to go for as little sugar as possible. Just try to keep it simple and don't do things you can't maintain long term.

Thanks for that. Yes, I often don't "play the tape all the way through." I say "Ooooo! Yummy!" and that's about as much thought as I put into it. I'll have to try that. Edit: Just saw Caramel Eggs one of my UK colleagues brought in the kitchen. Instead of saying "Oooo, yummy!" I thought "How many calories do I have left today? Do I have enough to spare including dinner?" The answer was yes, so I'm enjoying one (instead of the 2 or 3 I might have originally grabbed) with the apple I went in there to get in the first place. Small victories, right? Mrdzone

Absolutely, it's all about small victories. I think I posted on the facepages yesterday when I chose to not have FREE pizza and instead go buy a salad. It's all about the small victories.

Proud of myself this weekend, except I could have done better today (I'll explain below):Yesterday had the potential to be a disaster because we went over our friends' house for D&D and board games. I made sure we ate lunch before we left the house, and emailed my friend and asked what they were planning for dinner and if she would like to try the new recipe I found for enchilada pie (which meant I could control what went into it and how big portion sizes were). She was game, so I ended up cooking it at her house. I also brought some Jello temptations snacks with me because I figured, while they are fairly healthy eaters, there were likely to be chips around, and it's WAY easier to overeat on a bag of chips than it is on a finite amount of pudding snack. I ended up having some chips, but limited myself to a single serving, and also treated myself to a cider. Result? I stayed within my calories for the day. Today was not as successful, but not for the reason you'd think. We got up late (that always throws my day off), and ate "brunch", and then didn't really eat again until around 7:30-8pm. Result: I ate a lot of food around and after dinner (kiwi wrapped in salami was the star of the show ) to attempt to get into the calorie range for today, feel ill now, and still ate way fewer calories than I should have (just above 1000, with a target range of 1570-1920). I've got my lunch all packed for tomorrow, anyway, and made baked apple cinnamon walnut oatmeal for breakfast for the next few days, so at least that's all set. I've also planned out dinner tomorrow.So all in all, not a disastrous weekend by any means, but I wish I planned more for today so I could have been within my target range.

I always enjoy reading about actors who have to stay in great shape, particularly when they are honest about the trials and tribulations they go through. One that has always stuck with me was reading an article about Jamie Bamber (Apollo on Battlestar Galactica). He talks about how he doesn't like running on a treadmill, what works for him, what doesn't, and how he motivates himself. I particularly like the part where he talks about how he loves food. The main takeaway I got from it is that he found a happy medium where he enjoys getting fitter, and he enjoys getting fatter. To him, it's about finding that leeway that he can work within, so he knows when he can relax and eat hamburgers and enjoy it, and he knows when he needs to hit the running trails and enjoy that as well.I still have about 20 lbs to lose, but instead of having a target weight, I'm going to go with the bamber method, and instead have a target weight range, where once I hit the bottom of the range, I can relax, then when I hit the top of the range, it's time to crack down again. And learn to enjoy that moderate swing.

Sure papadage, here it is: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-appl ... etail.aspxMy modifications:I added an extra 1/2 cup of water since some of the comments were that it was dry.I substituted 1/2 ground flax seed for the wheat germ.I left out the raisins.When I make it again, I'll double the cinnamon and salt, probably add maybe 1/4 cup of Splenda, and use Granny Smiths instead of Braeburns (I think?) to try and brighten it up a bit, but it was still pretty good.

Managed to stay below 160 over the weekend. Big victory there (and according to the STF trendline it'll put my average below 160 by the end of the week!) but PAX East is looming in the background.

I think I'm just going to write it off. I've gotten to the point in my diet that I can pretty accurately judge the effect a particular food item is going to have on me, and as long as I stick closely to the script it shouldn't be too big an issue. Even this weekend, I didn't actually gain any weight on cheat day, and that included a half a pizza, a few beers, and lots of candy.The real problem this weekend is going to be the binge drinking, not the food.

I've got the added difficulty of the gluten allergy. There are usually very few things I can eat when I go to conferences, and I don't expect this to be any exception. Of course, this won't be in a strange city, so at least I've got that going for me. So now I know what happens when I severely undereat for a day: I get RAVENOUS the next day. I'm eating everything in sight today. Luckily there are not a whole lot of things in sight (purposely). Note to self: Don't do that again, dumbass. ronelson

Bring any two of an apple, orange, or pear and you've got something that will hold you over until you leave the venue and can get something relatively light and filling. Cut em or peel em in the hotel room and put them in some zip loc baggies (almonds are also good) and throw them in your rucksack.I find it impossible to believe that someone at such a large convention wouldn't sell some fresh fruit, too, if they prohibit you bringing any food items in.

After cutting carbs and dairy for a few weeks I reintroduced it yesterday. I had some fruit, cottage cheese, and a candy bar. It's more carbs in one day than I usually eat in a week, and this morning I was five pounds heavier. I feel off today so I'm going VLC. I've had only protein and fat for breakfast and lunch, and will eat non-starchy vegetables with dinner. That should get rid of the extra water.Posting my chart will have to wait for a few more days.

At least its fun watching it all drop off two pounds per day for the next three days.

April weigh in: 187.0 lbs, down 1.4lbs from March. This month has been a tremendous struggle for me as I had some medication changes (dropping the medicine to help me quit smoking) that seriously affected my appetite. I also cheated several weekends when I should not have. I'm still doing pretty good on choices of foods and servings sizes, but I was allowing myself an extra snack or two every day that weren't really necessary. I've also increased my carb intake ratio pretty significantly so I need to get that back under control as well. The gym has been a total disaster between illnesses and injury. I'll take final body measurements tonight, but I doubt I've seen any improvement from last month. For the coming month I really need to focus on 1) avoiding alcohol on the weekends, 2) maintaining control of my appetite, 3) consistency at the gym.

One more little success to smile about: We went to dinner with friends last night. Once upon a time, I would eat a full individual pizza (they have damn good gluten free pizza there!) and then share dessert with THBMan. Yesterday I was able to make myself stop after half the pizza and have the other half wrapped, and I had that for dinner tonight. I also shared the dessert 3 ways (they had a special gluten free dinner going on that we were too late for, but the waitress snagged me a whoopie pie... and how could I turn down a gluten free whoopie pie?!? ). But at least pizza-wise, hooray for willpower! Didn't get to do Couch to 5k tonight since I was at work late tonight, but I'm going to do it at the hotel tomorrow instead. dferrantino

As expected, gained almost 5 pounds at PAX this weekend. Also, as expected, lost 2.5 of them yesterday.I do need a scale recommendation though. I've been using my roommate's for the past year and a half and I've noticed it has a tendency to report the exact same number every time, almost as if it only steps in specific increments. In the grand scheme of things I know it doesn't matter but it worries me that it's not really accurate. I'm not looking for anything particularly fancy or expensive, just consistently accurate to the tenth of a pound.

I have only entered in two weights for subtractthefat.com but it is reported this huge 188.90 weight loss over "All Time". Is there a way to fix that? Also it only reports that in the stats page, the progress chart for "All Time" correctly shows a graph with two data points.

Goal for this month: break past the 180 barrier. My measurements also ended up surprising the hell out of me. I can't check my Fitocracy post right now to get the exact, but it was well over 1" lost off my waist and chest. I do remember that my waist measurement was down to 35.6" so chest is ~41". That puts me down about 3-4" overall since January!. I put on my nice suit for Easter and I was nearly swimming in the jacket. This is of course good news about weight loss progress....but I'm hoping the jacket shoulders still fit even after I get to my goal weight so I can get it tailored to fit me again. I *really* like that suit.

The body fat percentage was never even close to accurate, but it was consistently inaccurate, so it gave me a decent trend over time. The one thing to watch out for is that the body fat measurement is fairly sensitive to humidity, but most scales are.I feel weird lurking in here when I'm in a weight gaining phase of my life, but it's good to be reminded about what I'm going to be doing around October or so. The best way to lose baby weight is to avoid gaining it in the first place, so it's good to have a reminder that I should continue to be careful about what I eat. At my last dr's appointment, I'd only gained 6 pounds (which is pretty much exactly what I should have gained at that point), so I think I'm doing well. I've traditionally veered between carefully restricting calories and eating too much, so it's been an interesting experience to be eating more, but trying to do so in moderation. I've also always had 160 pounds as the hard max of what I would let myself get to, so it's an odd experience to hit that number and keep going. I've only hit 160 a couple of times in my life, but when I did I got very serious about my eating habits. Up to this point, it's the most I'd ever weighed.

I always got a different number. If there were any inaccuracies, they were consistent. It sounds like your roommate just has a crappy scale. dferrantino

Ok, ok, the optimal way to get back to your pre-baby weight is to avoid putting on excess weight and to breastfeed. JonTD

Good luck on breastfeeding. I was amazed at the difficulties some friends had at what is supposed to "come naturally."

My friend Ann tried with both of her daughters. Supposedly she would get about half milk, half blood.

yeah my wife produced several gallons per day which we froze, our friend who birthed a day later had trouble producing a teaspoon full. breastfeeding does not guarantee the weight will come off either.

Breast feeding is trivially easy for some women, initially VERY painful for some women (though that nearly always gets better if mom sticks with it) and flat out impossible for a statistically very small percentage of moms.Breast feeding a baby exclusively (breast milk is the only or very nearly only food source for babby) burns about 1000 calories per day iirc - 700ish calories in the milk itself, and another 300ish to produce it. Of anyone wants the "concrete" numbers I can look them up in a few minutes.If you do not increase your calorie intake for breast feeding, you will experience whatever results you would from that same caloric deficit caused by anything else (diet, exercise, whatever). Usually women who don't experience any weightloss from breast feeding are consuming extra calories, and I can personally attest that breastfeeding has a noticeable effect on appetitie. However. The body only needs sufficient amounts of water or other fluids to maintain milk production at normal levels (unless a woman is quite underweight to begin with).

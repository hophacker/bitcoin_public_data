Day four of quasi-atkins.Hunger pangs have subsided. Settling in around 1500 calories/day, which all the various calculators tells me that's about a 1800 calories above what's currently required to maintain my weight. We'll see if I can hold this, as it's pretty aggressive, and I'm frequently in social situation where consumption of food is part of things. My goal is about 80lbs of loss, which gets me around 250, which is still heavy, but at least at that weight I can do things like ride a bike relatively easily. My body type is going to me ever getting below 210 virtually impossible (Dr. backed this conclusion), without a massive lifestyle change, but even at my most active, in high school, I never got below 220. At that point I was running for 15 minutes/day in gym class and doing tons of physical stuff.That all said, I have to change things now, and the fiance is on-board with this in such a way that I think we can do it (she's also doing a similar diet, but targeted toward women). She's handling meal prep which makes it much easier for me to stay on track (laziness trumps desire to eat meat and other bad foods).So, the plan:MWF diet:7:45 - Atkins shake (180cal)10:00am - string cheese, half an apple (figuring about 120cal)12:00pm - Atkins shake, almonds and other half of apple (~250)2:00pm - some almonds and a half of a beef stick (combined I figure roughly 200cal)4:30pm - some kind of "graze" snack, like popcorn or rice cakes (100 calories)6:30pm - dinner (usually in the 400-600 calorie range)8:30pm - small snack/dessert, something under 100 caloriesTR diet:Same as above (I'm in class), except:6:30pm - small snack/dessert, something under 100 calories8:15ish - dinner (usually in the 400-600 calorie range)Saturday: stay under 2000 caloriesSunday:stay under 2500 caloriesTotal: 1350-1550So, yeah, kind of agressive, but we'll see what happens. Headaches were bad on Sunday and Monday, but more or less gone now. Yes, I'm hungry, but not at a level that's distracting. Blood sugar looks fantastic, if not a bit too low (yesterday is was at 66 when I tested before lunch ). The key seems to eat every couple hours, just keep it small.So, we'll see what results are in a couple weeks.

^^^Looks kinda low on "real food". I would try something more nutritionally complete if you have the time to prepare it. More fruit and veggies as snacks, for example. Less shakes and less rice cakes/popcorn (which are basically empty calories and bad for blood sugar).That said, ultimately I think losing weight is about results. Unless you go crazy and go on to a grapefruit diet or something, a short-term nutritional deficiency is probably not a big deal if you are successful at shedding the weight.

Unless you go crazy and go on to a grapefruit diet or something, a short-term nutritional deficiency is probably not a big deal if you are successful at shedding the weight.Well, the shakes are actually pretty decent on nutrients. And I'm eating an apple and almonds, which are pretty decent in terms of nutrition.Plus, dinner tends to include a lot of veggies, seeing as the fiance is a pescetarianism, and we live in the upper midwest (i.e. not a lot of great fish options beyond what comes frozen).That all said, I'm type 2, so keeping blood sugar low is an added side-effect of this kind of diet. The grazing stuff is to keep the snacking urges at bay. Like, tonight we're having paneer and broccoli with panang curry over rice. It's a big bowl of food, and very filling, but clocks in right around 550 calories (including the 1.5 cup of rice). She tends to use a lot of cauliflower, broccoli, butternut squash and whatnot in her cooking. She also makes a lot of soups, which are great. I rarely eat one of her meals and feel like I'm at all hungry. The fiance is running point on a lot of the meals, and she gets home at 4:15 every day and starts cooking, so when I get home (usually around 5:30pm) we usually eat right away. The nights we can't cook, tend to be a run to our local [url="http://www.willystreet.coop/"]Co-op[/url] for salad bar and splitting a demi-baguette. It's a remarkably satisfying meal.If I'm worried about anything, it's salt. I drink at least 40oz of water a day at work, and usually at least 20oz with dinner, but I might have to up that a bit.We have always eaten well, but we just at too much. That said, I've lost about 18lbs since Jan 1, and that was just with minimal change in that I basically went vegetarian during the weekdays, and reduced breakfast portions to a cup of yogurt and a piece of string cheese. So, this is a bit more of a step forward. WE'll see how it goes.

/me high fives waubersWay to go, man! I've felt like crap all week this week (headaches and generally exhausted) so I haven't been doing couch to 5k. I have, however, been sticking to the diet, so that's good. Tomorrow I have a sleep study. Hopefully they find something treatable so I don't wake up exhausted every morning anymore.

The other women in my workplace have started a one month only Biggest Loser style competition. I'm not playing. I am trying to lose weight since I've got both my class reunion and my brother's wedding coming up this fall, but they're going about it all wrong. The competition is straight poundage lost. Not percentage or body fat or anything useful. Some of those women weigh about 100 lbs more than I do. Edit: I heard earlier that everyone involved is taking it seriously and making progress. So good for them on that account. I just don't think a month is long enough to produce real weight loss numbers.

4 more lbs until I'm not longer 'obese' according to BMI. I'm sorely tempted to just sauna it up for 20 minutes a day through the weekend to make it, but I know it'll bo so much nicer when it happens naturally. Plus who knows, maybe after my run tomorrow I'll get a sudden 3-4 lbs drop, it's happened before. Plus I haven't really exercised in over a week. Been too crazy.

Rock on, Mrdzone! That's AWESOME!!! I can't wait to get there, but I've got a LONG way to go. I've lost ~6 pounds so far this time, and that was from a point that was 8 pounds down from my highest weight. So 14 is good, but I've got 90+ pounds to go.

So after doing some research I ordered a new scale from Amazon. I thought my old digital one was ok, but I got weird measurements last night. When you scale does this:Test 1: 187.2Test 2: 185.8Test 3-5: 184.9Test 6: 183.7Test 7: 186.0Test 8: 185.4Test 9-11: 186.4Test 12-13: 185.8...it's time for a new scale. The number seemed to change depending on where my feet were, whether my weight was on my toes or my ankles, etc.. I finally just gave up and decided to order a new scale. FWIW, I order an EatSmart scale from Amazon for $30. I don't really care about the body fat and hydration measurements since I've not seen any scale that reportedly does them consistently accurately.

I need to hit 202 to not be obese so over 90 lbs is definitely doable, It took me over a year though, but I wasn't strict that entire time. and I haven't been graet about tracking. Here's the whole shebang so far, you can see there's definitely been periods where I haven't tracked as well as I should have. C'est la Vie. Mrdzone

We'll see.

I know what you mean about being tempted. I'm within a few pounds of a normal BMI and also want to do something to just get there.I have had one weigh-in at a normal BMI, but it was after a 36 hour water fast, so IMO it doesn't count.

I haven't posted my chart in a long time so here goes. Just a few more pounds to go, then I will switch my focus to getting stronger and faster.I estimate I was around 215 lbs at my heaviest so I'm 50lbs down at this point, and about 10% body fat, give or take 3%.

It's been an incredibly frustrating couple of days. I've been pretty good about keeping to my calorie range (1610 and 1960 calories/day) except for one day this past weekend when I went over by about 300 calories (but I went under by 400 the day before). I did cardio for ~35 minutes on Monday, and will do cardio again today and on Friday. Yet I've gained 3 pounds in the last three days. I don't have my period, so that's not the reason (I always gain around then). I'm drinking plenty of water, so that's not it. I realize that this is a long-term thing, but really? Not gonna lie, very demotivated today. Pysgard

How's the sleep been? That is my biggest contributing factor. If I only get 6, it's usually a bad sign I'll be trending up. 8 and I'm both more content without so much desire to snack, and I lose weight seemingly without as much deficit.

I need to keep it in check today, tomorrow, and friday, as I'm still have .5 inches off of comfortable on the new suit I bought. Although the last time I was in troy I managed to not eat too poorly .. only had ale house and wasn't tempted by i loves since it was passover. This weekend though I'm bringing home pies for the roommates Also in regards to the puppet fight commment above: Pysgard

It's interesting to me to see how much you deflate while you sleep. I also learn a whole lot about how my body interacts with what I'm eating and how much I'm exercising.

ACSM recommend 150 minutes per week as a minimum just to maintain.acsm new guidelines for exerciseQuote:New research shows that "between 150 and 250 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity is effective in preventing weight gain greater than 3% in most adults but will provide "only modest" weight loss." So ACSM has published new physical activity recommendations in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Overweight and obese individuals are more likely to lose weight and keep it off if they exercise for least 250 minutes per week. Exercising for more than 250 minutes per week has resulted in "significant" weight loss for these individuals. I'm back on the keto after slipping off keto while my parents visited for 3 months. ugh. stepping up my workouts too.

I've never exercised to that level. IMHO (and only anecdotally) I've lost all my weight working out for around 100 minutes a week at most. Now I do tend to walk more but I don't consider that 'moderate intensity physical activity'

That said, I averaged 1750/day over the last week. I'm trying to fall somewhere on the middle of that scale, and not constantly topping it out.I just got the P90 Boot Camp program, so I'm planning on starting that up soon on alternate days with the cardio. That said, again, I'm carrying around a lot of extra weight, so even doing the couch to 5k has been challenging for me so far.

Don't even start p90 you'll get wayyy to demoralized. I tried it (well p90x) and it made me feel like shit for weeks. Unless you're perfectly comfortable with not being able to do half the shit for half as long as they can (I wasn't) I don't have any recommendations for other workout tapes but just be prepared. FWIW my bodybugg tells me I'm burning about 3k calories a day just being me and I'm just on the BMI line between overweight and obese. I figure even if that's off by 20% that's still 2400 calories a day I need to maintain...

katespace, get a copy of the 8 Minute Abs/Buns/Arms/Legs combo DVD. Do one of them a day for a week or two, then two a day, and then go from there. Within a month you should be able to do all four every day, and then add small hand weights or ankle bands after another month. Don't do P90X if you aren't already in pretty good shape, or at least not moderately close to your target weight. It'll hurt and demoralize you. The 8 Minute routine is low impact, and will get you some tone and endurance, and you get to watch Tony Horton, the P90X trainer with 80s hair.

Within a month you should be able to do all four every day, and then add small hand weights or ankle bands after another month. Don't do P90X if you aren't already in pretty good shape, or at least not moderately close to your target weight. It'll hurt and demoralize you. The 8 Minute routine is low impact, and will get you some tone and endurance, and you get to watch Tony Horton, the P90X trainer with 80s hair.Can you link this dvd? TY

Even when I got six weeks into it, before twisting my ankle running and needing to take time off, I had to easy myself into it, at first doing just half the workouts for a week, then the full duration, but cutting each exercise down by ten seconds or so, to get a breather. It was only after about three weeks of that before i was able to to them at full intensity and actually started counting the days. Don't even get me started on trying to do the abs workout on the same day as some of the other hour long routines.Mrdzone, the full routines are on YouTube, so look at them here:Abs - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNqrkGnkUWcBuns - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnBhn7YSsnMArms - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSby1UUhytsLegs - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLIfN-31BgsThe original DVD is not sold anymore, but my girlfriend has a copy, so I would use hers. There are newer versions of the old one on Amazon, but reviews are mixed. It is damn easy to rip YouTube streams though.. Just buy one of their other products and do what you want with the links above. Or look on eBay.

That said, I averaged 1750/day over the last week. I'm trying to fall somewhere on the middle of that scale, and not constantly topping it out.I just got the P90 Boot Camp program, so I'm planning on starting that up soon on alternate days with the cardio. That said, again, I'm carrying around a lot of extra weight, so even doing the couch to 5k has been challenging for me so far.Most people tend to underestimate the amount of calories that they're consuming. I would cut calories down further in order to give yourself a little bit of wiggle room. As long as you're keeping above 1200 calories a day, you should be fine.

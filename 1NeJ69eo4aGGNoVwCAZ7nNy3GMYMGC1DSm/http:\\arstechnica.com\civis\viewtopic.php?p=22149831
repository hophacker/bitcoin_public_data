While I'm loathe to provide a Gawker link, I will.Quote:So that's fun, only it would be way more fun if they were fighting each other rather than teaming up like total gaylords to fight some Swedish guy. Yeah, the main villain in this bitch seems to be Loki from Thor, the near-androgynous slitherer played with panache by Tom Hiddleston. Everyone gets sad that he's trying (and succeeding, at least partially, from the looks of it) to blow up New York, so they say "Hey let's form a Babysitter's Club. I'm the Kristy!" Lots of tough guy banter abounds and then Scarlett Johansson shows up and says "Tits!" and all the supahheroes say "Hubba hubba..." and Thor carries her away to his thatched hut by the sea. Pretty straightforward superhero movie.Sounds like a good watch to me. Will wait for it to appear on a streaming service, though.

Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is really rubbing me the wrong way (I thought Edward Norton did a great job, but apparently he's Hollywood-difficult), but the rest looks great. Cap's suit looks bad, though. Kind of wish they'd kept the 40s suit.

Loki is the big villain? Bleh. But ok, fine. I'll reserve judgement on Ruffalo. I didn't like Norton's Banner at all.I suspect the best part of the Avengers movie will be Downey, as it should be. Happysin

It was quite fun, in that "It's two hours of America, Fuck Yah!" and completely guilt-free, as we're fighting someone so villainous that he betrayed the Nazis because they were too nice.

I was totally underwhelmed by both Thor and Captain America. I have low expectations.How is The Hulk part of the avengers anyway? Doesn't he just smash everything uncontrollably or will he have consciousness of his actions?

I think the whole part at the end of Incredible Hulk was meant to get Hulk ready for the Avengers movie. You know, where Banner triggers a change, his eyes go yellow and he smiles as if he finally figured out how to control the beast.That said, I'm guessing if Banner gets really mad, Hulk still SMASH!

I figured that the first part of the movie would be Loki tricking Hulk to attack NYC. Then it takes all of the Avengers to stop Hulk. They figure out a way for Hulk to stay in control. Anyway, if anyone wants a good primer of The Avengers check out Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes on Netflix. It is a really great cartoon series from last year.

I would just like to go on record that the rotating door that is The Hulk's actors is a tribute to how indelible the mark of Lou Ferrigno is on the character. Zaphod

A couple of things:Evidently the trailer got out a bit early, because part way through they splash "This May" on the screen. And it is a little past May 2011.As an old guy, but not a comic book junkie I am going to say that I don't really remember Bruce Banner ever joining anything, I just remember that whatever the crisis, The Hulk would show up to the party and somehow manage to cause more damage to the bad guys than to the good guys.

Thor embraced it's comic-ness more, and was more fun. Captain America was a decent movie, but took itself a little too seriously for me.

The Avengers just made him useful.

I've seen some teaser type pictures of Loki meant to scary him up that obscures part of his look. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not necessarily Loki in his original form but maybe something has infected him or something like that.Also, I really like the quip from Stark at the end targeted at Banner.

I haven't seen a couple of the constituent films (Thor, Captain America), but I really liked the two Iron Man movies, so I'll probably see this eventually just for RDJr. I'll probably wait until it hits DVD/Netflix, though.I liked Ed Norton as Bruce Banner though, it's disappointing that he's not reprising the role BitPoet

Was the statement released BEFORE the last <rotating time demarcation>? Then it was probably that one. Else, by deduction, it is the next one. Not hard, especially 5 months after the last one and a trailer that is clearly not 5 months old.

The idea of a "good" superhero movie now is a really tough sell for me. Unless it's a sharp anti-hero story like Watchmen or the Batmen, I just don't see how it's not already been done ... a lot. I love Joss as much as the next guy but how much can he really bring given the system? It's big time Hollywood no matter who's directing, so how different can it be if it's Joss Whedon, Michael Bay, Ridley Scott or James Cameron? No doubt he will do a commendable job of dealing with the existing mythology and advancing it in a way that is true to the tradition and history of the comics. But we're still looking at 120 minutes of explosions, right? Maybe I'm too cynical.

usually you can just half everything buy when I have done this in the past and did small batch brewing, halving the hops was not ideal. Halfing some of the amounts gets into the micro amounts. There are hop calculators out there for small batch brewing from memory.

OK, follow up on my previous halfbatch question. I picked up the midwest supplies groupon today, and the kit comes with an ingredients kit. I'm sticking with my plan to do a half batch, so targeting 2.5 gallons. I'll be working with a 20 qt stockpot. Should I do my boil with 2.5 gallons of water for the whole process, or should I boil 1 or 1.5 gallons and then add the rest of the water post-boil? The 20 qt pot should be plenty big to handle the full amount of water, but the kit instructions seem to assume that you're boiling 2.5 gallons of water for 5 gallons at the end, so they expect you to add quite a bit of water post boil.I'm watching some micro-batch videos on you tube, and the best one I've found has the guy doing his steeping with 0.5 gallon, then adding the rest of the water before adding the DME. He doesn't really explain why he steeped with less than the full amount of water though.

The idea behind steeping in less than the full boil volume is that lower pH during the steep is desirable, as it prevents the leaching of tannic acids from the husk into the steeping water. The higher the grain to water ratio, the lower the pH should get, approaching 5.2, IIRC. DePending on the amount of steeping grains, you should adjust your amount of steeping water. This is also related to the temp of the steep, with higher temps also promoting tannin extraction. The thicker and darker the steep, the higher you can go.

I tried adjusting the beer calculator on hopville to have steep at 1 gallon and then boil the hops at 2.5 gallons, and it made my OG really high. Perhaps I'm not entering that in correctly. Should I be aiming for steeping at 1 gallon, then topping off to 2.5 gallons for the boil, and then top it off again to 2.5 before pitching the yeast (in case too much has boiled off)?

I will say that there's no reason it should affect OG to steep at low volume. Steeping grains in general only add a very low number of ppgYeah, you have the thrust of it there. Hop utilization is similar to tannins in that higher pH will extract it better, but its actually desirable. So yes, top water up for the boil, then top up again at the end.

OK, a few more questions that I think I know the answer to, but I want to avoid any blatantly rookie mistakes.For primary fermentation, I have three places in the house where I can store the fermenter: -An upstairs room that will be mid to high 60s in the spring, fall and winter, mid to high 70s in the summer-A downstairs room that will be high 60s to low 70s in the summer, potentially dropping to low to mid 60s at night in the winter-The basement which is probably low to mid 60s all year long, maybe dipping slightly colder in the winter.I figure that I want the ambient temp of whatever room I have my fermentation happening in to be high 60s to low 70s, so I'm thinking that during the summer I should ferment in the downstairs room, and then store bottles in the basement after carbination, and during the winter I should ferment in the upstairs room. Am I over thinking this? I'm trying to avoid ice baths and heating pads. Reading over the kit instructions online, they don't really seem to be concerned with ambient room temperature to the extent that you guys are.

Generally speaking yes, ales are best fermented in the high 60's to low 70's. That said, do consider the type of beers and adjust accordingly. For example, Belgian and Hefeweizen yeasts like higher temps than Irish stout or American Wheat yeasts. Were I doing a quad or hefe in the summer I'd put them in the upstairs room, would ferment a stout in the downstairs room, and a Kolsch in the basement. Wyeast and White Labs both list temperature ranges for each strain on their website, just check them when your planning a given batch.:edit: That said, don't overthink it (something I can be guilty of). There's absolutely nothing wrong with sticking with the mid-range temperature, just that playing with temps can accentuate the flavors. The banana/clove flavors in a hefe come out stronger in a higher temperature fermentation, but you'll still find the classic notes if fermented at 70 vs 78. In general higher fermentation temperatures for ale yeasts tend to lead to greater ester production, lower can lead to cleaner more neutral profiles. It can be fun to do the same exact recipe and expose it to different environments to see exactly how it's different.

I brewed my first 5-gallon batch last night and it was not a complete disaster. The water from my faucet is lousy, so I opted to buy a couple of 2.5-gal Poland spring jugs. I used one for the boil and the other to top-up for fermentation (which served to both decrease the time to boil on my stove and served to chill it from boiling to under 140*F). chilling it the rest of the way without a wort chiller or an ice bath was a pain - I ended up filling my tub, draining it, and filling it again. that got the wort down to 85* and I called it good. I only had one almost-boilover, when I stepped away from the pot after turning up the heat - it went from 160* to boiling a lot faster than I expected! now I'm getting decent activity out of the airlock. . . I definitely wish I had a carboy or better bottle to observe it!I'm definitely going to give serious consideration to a wort chiller before I do my next batch.

If you only do partial boils, and you're using bottled water anyhow, chill the top off water in the fridge ahead of time, and you can probably stop chilling earlier and top off with the cold water.

Anyone have a tried and true porter recipe? I've made a few great ones, but I didn't write em down. And my most recent attempts have been quite...meh. I know I had a touch of rauchmalt and 8oz special B. Beyond that?Also, we have fairly soft water, so if your water is different, I can adjust.

Last I checked, a copper wort chiller constructed from scratch will run you around $50-60, mostly due to the copper tubing. Aluminum might be cheaper, but I'm not sure how easy it is to bend into the right shape without crimping the tube.For some of us just starting out, a wort chiller is probably on the list of things to purchase eventually, but there are other pieces of equipment that are more essential.

A 20' coil should do the job though, and is $20 on the homedepot site for 1/4". 3/8" is $40. I paid $35 for a 50' coil in 2009. You can use any appropriately sized cylinder to coil around...Just put the cylinder in the center of the coiled tube and start tightening. I used a corny, but mines too large for my stovetop pans. And I was handed down one to start, so I had it easy.

I made one back in 2001 or so (granted copper has gone up a lot since then) and it was literally less than 20 dollars and 20 minutes. I wrapped 3/8" tubing around a 3lb coffee can, and used hose clamps to attach rubber tubing to each end. On one end of the tubing, and I used a hose clamp and an adapter to connect it to a waterbed filler adapter, which screwed into my sink faucet. I could chill a 5 gallon boil in less than 10 minutes.Also, I'd bet if you go to a local homebrew club chapter meeting, you'll be able to find someone who has a spare. (either they sized up to 15 gallon batches, or moved on to a cold plate.)

FWIW 50' of 3/8" copper is $70-90 @ McMaster. as for the time. . . I steeped the specialty grains for 20 minutes, the boil was an hour, and it took me about 20 minutes to get it down to the mid-80s using my tub. It probably would have been considerably different had I done a full boil and not relied on my topping-up water for some cooling.

^Ah, didn't realize you were tub cooling. I never tried that...it seemed too dangerous in a "whoops! splashed tub water in mah worts!" or "holy chit my hands are burning!" kind of way.If copper is really that much, then a cold plate chiller starts to look very attractive.

How many feet of copper tubing do you need to be effective? Would 10' be too short to get proper heat transfer? 10' sections of 3/8" copper are not too expensive.

A 5 gallon boiler should probably use a 20-25' coil. 15 gallons is probably best with at least 35', and more likely 50'.It doesn't really change anything to have a shorter coiler, it's just not as efficient at removing heat due to less dwell time. Ergo, it takes longer to cool. (then again, I suppose you could chill the water in advance too, to increase delta and thus transfer rate)

Yeah, I'm talking about a 10' section of soft copper coil. $13 currently, which probably drops it into the category of "well, I'm dropping all this money on a kit anyway, so why not". A 20' coil is just shy of $30, which starts creeping towards "well, I'm dropping all of this money on a kit, so maybe I'll pick that up later". If that mentality makes sense.The cold water coming out of my kitchen tap is reasonably cold even in the summer, so I'm not worried too much about that. However, if a 10' section is not going to work properly, I don't want to waste money if I'm just going to have to get a bigger section later anyway. Couldn't I just run the water a little more slowly to increase the dwell time? Or is it a surface area thing?Edit: Oh, and relevant data: I'm the guy who wants to stick with 2.5-3 gallon batches, so I'll be cooling 2.5 gallons of liquid in a 20qt stockpot. (about 15" diameter)

I'm thinking about my old chiller here, and assuming that coffee can was 12" across, you'd only get three wraps with a 10' coil. That doesn't seem like a lot.In any event, the water will flow at whatever rate you fill the pipe, and more cold water is always better than longer dwell time. (too much dwell time and you're really not transferring much more heat into the cooling liquid). I think, even with a 10' coil, if you bought some extra rubber tubing and ran your water feed through an ice bath (say, in the sink) it would probably work fine.

I think mine is 25 or 30 feet of 3/8th tubing? and it works perfectly fine in my keggle. For 10 gallon boils I'd want the 50 feet version. but 25 feet is perfectly fine for 5 gal batches, my last batch was 7 gallons after boil and it was fine in it.

1/4" will work. It's a bit resistant to flow and has a higher surface:volume ratio than the more common 3/8". To balance this, I actually suggest going with 20' or a little less to help keep the resistance to flow low.It won't chill as fast as 3/8" at full bore, but it will still chill in ~30min with reasonably cold water. I sometimes use a submersible pump in a cooler of ice-water to chill super fast.

I swear the Home Depot web site is giving me different prices every time I look, but if the $14 for 20' of 1/4" tubing is correct, I could probably put the whole thing together for $30 or so.Edit: Product description says "Max operating temp: 150 F". I assume that's just if I'm pumping actual refrigerant under pressure, right? Shouldn't be a problem with cold water on the inside and boiling water on the outside?

Additional question: The only single tube bender I can find is a $4 3/8" bender from Ace. Every other store only sells sets. Can I use a 3/8" bender to bend 1/4" tubing?

If you basically place your mold cylinder (be it a smaller pot, or what have you) and tighten the coil around the mold, you should basically have no issue. The touchiest part is getting the input and output arms up and pointed out. Larger radius turns should be used where possible. Not strictly NecessaryIf you can get your hands on some scrap solid core wire, or get ~1 foot of 3 conductor 14 guage Romex (should be ~$1/ft) and strip it to bare copper, use the wire to space the coils and add support to the in/out arms. I'd clean the wire with a scrubby, but it otherwise is fine for this application.EDIT: One last thing. Make the input the top of the coil. Since this is the coolest water and the hottest wort, it promotes even cooling and helps prevent stratification of hot wort on top and cold on bottom.

"Tube" benders are for the more rigid piping...soft copper coils can easily be bent by hand.

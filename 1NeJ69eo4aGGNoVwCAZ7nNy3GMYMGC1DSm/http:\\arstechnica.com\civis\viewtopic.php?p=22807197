Yeah, I'm only really worried about the 90 degree bends to get the input and output parts in place.

A firm grip and a thumb are all that are necessary. Just don't grab the coil far apart and go all HULK SMASH on it, and you'll be fine.

So when I inevitably kink the tube, I can send you the bill for a replacement, right? Given that getting a second tube is the same price as buying a tube bender set, I'll probably just freehand it, but it will be interesting.

You'll see what I mean. It's very easy to manipulate it. Use many small, gentle bends versus big sweeping strong movements.

I used something like this for bending sharper angles. I don't remember if I actually got my set at Harbor Freight, but it looks pretty much identical.

I think you ought to be able to find a similar spring-style set for pretty cheap though. Home depot shows a couple sets for $10-12 (albeit with crappy online listings that don't specify diameters).EDIT: Harbor Freight has an $11 kit with 1/4" though 1/2" benders, a cutting tool, and something called a flaring set. No idea what that last one even does.

Right, and at $12, I could just buy a replacement tubing coil if bending it by hand goes bad. I think I can get away without doing any sharp corners. It might not look fancy, but it will get the job done.

Status update / knowledge bombHit up Lowes this afternoon for supplies. As a PSA, apparently copper prices are going up right now. Ace just doubled their prices this week, but Lowes has not yet. If you're thinking of doing a copper chiller, now might be a good time.Also interesting, apparently most of the soft copper tubing is refrigerant grade, which is allowed to contain lead, cadmium, arsenic, all sorts of fun stuff. I guess to be food safe you need C12200 alloy, or one of the various potable water certifications. At Lowes, the cheapest brand, JMF, ended up being the one to go with. I called their customer service line, they answered the phone right away, and I read the SKU to them over the phone and they told me which ones were C12200. Very cool customer service, so thumbs up to them, and the guy at Lowes who helped me track down all the mis-shelved variants. 20' of 1/4" copper acquired for just under $14.The coil was basically already in the right shape, so I just widened it a little and stacked it around the outside of a sauce pot. I didn't use any tube benders, so my in and out stems don't look very pretty since I went with gentle curves instead of 90 degree bends, but it will work.Total material cost: $38 including tax (plus driving to Lowes I guess, so a buck of gas). I probably could have kept that under $30 for materials if our kitchen sink had a standard aerator attachment. I had to MacGuyver something really weird together. The plumbers epoxy is curing now, but I'll test it for being water-tight tomorrow.So... how to I clean this thing? I assume that I should cleanse it somehow before using it with a food product. Soak it in a bucket of vinegar?

normally the recommendation is to just put it in the wort for the last few minutes of the boil; that will sanitize it. I might run a solution of sanitizer through it beforehand if you can get enough of a siphon.

Well, yes, I assume putting it in the boiling wort will sanitize it, but what about cleaning it before letting it get in contact with the wort. I'm thinking chemicals rather than microbes. This just came out of a box marked for refrigerant, not food. The metal is mostly shiny copper, but a few spots are a little darker. Should I be at all concerned with washing anything off the surface of the copper before the first use? It a good rinse in water good enough?

I brewed my second 5-gallon batch last night. It was pretty uneventful. I stuck my top-up water (2.5 gallon poland spring jug) in the fridge a few hours before I brewed; the combination of that + the cold water in the tub was enough to drop the wort to 100* (similar to last time). I would've liked to get it lower, but it was getting late (10:30) and I just wanted to be done with it. I left it overnight (lid on!) and it was at 80* this morning, so I pitched the yeast after re-hydrating. this weekend I am definitely either making or buying a wort chiller and buying some tubing to match the autosiphon (I got 1/2" tubing with the kit, I think the autosiphon needs 7/16").I've been using the gas stove in my kitchen and doing partial (2.5 gallon) boils and it's getting frustrating to take so long to bring the water up to temperature - fortunately I have a propane burner, so I'm going to use that for the next batch (which won't be for a while, since I've got 10 gallons fermenting!). I might try a cider next. My beer accoutrements are starting to take up nearly as much space as my cycling gear.Quote:Also interesting, apparently most of the soft copper tubing is refrigerant grade, which is allowed to contain lead, cadmium, arsenic, all sorts of fun stuff.

Finally got my beer up and running. Two brews so far from kit, an American Pale and an English Brown. Both kits were designed for stovetop brewing with a 2.5 gallon wort with water added at end to make 5 gallons. I have the kit to brew full batch from begining though, so I started with 6 gallons on the APA (ended up with 4) and 7 gallons (closer to 5.5 at the end) for the Brown. Good initial fermentation action. Used a secondary for the APA because I needed the primary bucket for the second. Want to use second for the brown because I wasn't able to avoid the trub during transfer. Nailed the OG on the APA, forgot to measure on the Brown. Bottling in 10 days, will be brewing weekly for a while. 3.5 more kits and then it's all grain from there on out. One of my kits had a bad can of liquid extract so I'll mash up 6 lbs of grain as a transition batch. I'm excited to finally be doing this.

Last year, because she is awesome, Mrs. Group gave me two hop rhizomes for our anniversary (Centennial and Cascade). I'm hoping to get usable hops from them this year, but it has dawned on me that I have no idea how to determine their alpha acid content. Now, generally speaking, I've got no problem brewing beer on a best-guess basis and having it be potentially fantastic but impossible to replicate.I do have a problem brewing beer that turns out undrinkable. So it seems like I'll want to know at least their approximate AAU numbers; I don't want to guesstimate 5 and have it be 8, for example.This has got to be a solved problem...right?

AFAIK, you have to send them out to be tested. Most people just use published averages for each rhizome.Or they don't use them as bittering hops.

I've always just gone by what my local brew shop lists as the content; I've never really compared one season's crop to another. If we're talking about the difference between 6 and 7 AAU, then I don't care. With as slipshod an operation as I run, that won't even be close to the least precise part of the brew. If we're talking about 4 to 8 AAU, though, even I'll have to care.Although I suppose just not using them as bittering hops is a workable solution. I admit to being somewhat enthralled with the idea of increasing the "home" part of "homebrew," but it really wouldn't be such a big deal to keep several ounces of (say) Galena on hand just for baseline bittering.I probably won't be able to resist at least one brew with the Centennial for bittering and the Cascade for finishing, though.

II don't have enough experience to say...most of my knowledge about homebrewing is from many years ago when I was closer to it (and in a club) or from my neighbors that brew...and none of them grow their own hops, but the new neighbors are considering it.

What's the best way to dry hop? Drop the hop pellets right in the secondary fermenter, or put them in a sanitized grain bag first? I've got a feeling that the grain bag would just float on top of the surface, but at least it wouldn't clog up my auto-siphon.Is about a week before bottling the right timing?

OK, non-Mr. Beer kit acquired from Midwest Supplies today. I also got an autosiphon, star-san, a spring loaded bottling wand, and had to go back for a thermometer. Tomorrow I'm going to try my first batch, which will be a half batch of Autumn Amber Ale.

I'd like to use my mr beer as a supplementary fermenter, either for half batches or to experiment with different yeast strains. I picked up parts for a chiller from lowe's yesterday. . . $40 for 20' of 3/8 OD cu tubing and various fittings. I'll get it together this week; I don't plan on another batch until next week at the earliest - I have to bottle the two batches I have fermenting now!

OK, first batch is in the fermenter. A few questions now though:1) The kit's estimated OG was 1.043, but my hydrometer reading came in closer to 1.039. Is that likely to be a problem? Any idea what I might have done wrong to cause that?2) The wort was really foamy after pouring it into the bucket, even before stirring it or adding the yeast. I assume that normal, but the instructions didn't really mention it.3) The dry yeast pack says it will basically be done fermenting in 2-3 days. However, the kit says to leave it in the fermenter for 1-2 weeks. What's the best practice here? Leave it in for the full 2 weeks? Bottle after 1 week?A few of the upgrades people recommended over the basic kit really paid off. My homemade wort chiller worked like a champ, especially after I started stirring. 212 to <100 in about 10 minutes, and down to 75 in about 10 more minutes. Also, the larger pot really paid off (I started with 3 gallons of liquid in a 5 gallon pot). Didn't even come close to a boil over. Next upgrade that I'm seeing a need for is a thief. I used a sanitized turkey baster to fill the tube the hydrometer came in, but that didn't really work as smoothly as I would have liked.

I really wish the LME had come in two little jugs instead of one big one, but it should keep for a week or two in the fridge.I did pick up some extra packets of SAF-05 for when I brew the second half of the kit.

Extra pale ale kit (Nugget hops) with additional Cascade hops during primary. Stayed super clean during all processes and ended up with great results - clear amber body and creamy billowing head. It has been about 50 days since primary fermentation and it tastes better each successive week.Next up is a double IPA!

After 2 days of pretty regular bubbling (once every 7 seconds like clockwork), my airlock now has zero activity. I used Muntons dry yeast which I know can be pretty quick to ferment, and I used the whole packet even though I was doing a half batch, but that's much faster than I thought it would go. Is there any harm in picking up the bucket and swirling it around a bit to mix things back up again?

Well, I had planned on having my last Mr. Beer batch be ready to drink while I'm waiting for my first real batch to mature. However, 4 weeks after bottling I tried one and it was... not good. It had tasted a little off when I tried a sample while bottling, but I went ahead anyway figuring it would settle out eventually. After my first not so good bottle, I let it sit for another couple of weeks and tried another bottle this weekend. If anything, this one was worse. Symptoms:-fizzy, but zero head retention. It's like soda.-slight metallic taste, which is weird because the only metal it came in contact with was the can the extract came in and the stainless steel pot.-an off flavor that I don't know how to identify based on the usual lists of off flavors. Perhaps the "solvent" flavor? Not sure really since I've never tasted solvent. It doesn't really have an off smell, just a bad taste.-horrible mouth feel. It sort of burns my tongue and mouth.At this point, it's not even worth cooking with. I'll let it sit for a while to see if it ever improves since I don't need the Mr. Beer bottles any more, but this was disappointment. I'm wondering if I somehow got bacteria or wild yeast in there, or if maybe it fermented at too high of a temp, or maybe I just got a bad batch of extract. 5 weeks until my first specialty grain and extract batch is ready to drink.

I had a batch that was neglected in secondary for about 3 months; I bottled it without pitching any yeast and it apparently did not have any living creatures left from the initial pitch. Let's just say that it's flat. It, fortunately, tastes OK so will make a good cooking beer.We did bottle a farmhouse ale using a Belgian Saisan yeast 2 weeks ago; I cracked one of those last night and it is very nice. Low ABV, crisp, etc.

My American Pale Ale spent a week in primary and 2 in secondary and is ready to bottle. I just got my party pig delivered and am contemplating using it right away.Couple questions: I'm not too concerned about labels and will soak for a few minutes in PBW solution, rinse by dipping in distilled water, and then into a bucket of starsan before bottling. I've been judicious about rinsing these commercial microbrew bottles clear after drinking and I think this will be sufficient.-carboy cleaning. Will cleaning solution alone be enough to clean the better bottles?

It's like soda.-slight metallic taste, which is weird because the only metal it came in contact with was the can the extract came in and the stainless steel pot.-an off flavor that I don't know how to identify based on the usual lists of off flavors. Perhaps the "solvent" flavor? Not sure really since I've never tasted solvent. It doesn't really have an off smell, just a bad taste.-horrible mouth feel. It sort of burns my tongue and mouth.could be the begining stages of vinegar. hard to tell, vinegar does not fizz and needs to 'breath' to convert the alcohol to vinegar. being capped, it may still be in the starting stages.

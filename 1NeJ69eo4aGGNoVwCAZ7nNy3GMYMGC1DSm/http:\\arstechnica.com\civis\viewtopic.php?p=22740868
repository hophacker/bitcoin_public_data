Sitting at home just about an hour ago, reading, and I hear a car come flying thru the parking lot at the condo. I was like "He is going way too fast for the parking lot". Look out the window only to see a minivan slam nose first into a tree at about 40 or so MPH. Mind you this guy was screaming thru the parking lot.Throw the shoes on really quick and grab my phone and keys. By the time I get out to the car, the kid driving is trying to get the car back into gear.I can clearly see both front airbags have deployed, and the minivan got pushed back by the collision a good 10 feet from the tree he hit. I tell the kid stay in the car and don't move, I'm calling the police and fire.Kid starts freaking out.People start showing up from other buildings in the area.Kid starts freaking out more. Then he notices I'm wearing a Plymouth County Sherriff t-shirt I am wearing and which he loses it and starts to walk away from the crash. Thankfully he is a bit too dazed to go too far.Cops show up, talk to the kid, talk to me at which time he starts to argue with the police. The police ask me to step away for a second while the kid throws a fit, trying to punch and kick the police, then he tries to spit on the police. Bad move. Police then take kid to the ground, handcuff and ankle cuff him and toss him in the back of the cruiser.Lead officer comes back over asks me a few questions. I point to the bag of drugs the kid threw out of the car as he got out of the car the first time when I walked out.Such a pleasant night...

There are times you wish Darwin would work a little harder to weed out the idiots in the gene pool - drunk drivers being one of those times and when they hit trees and no other people being the best time to do that work. The laws are generally way too lenient on these crimes imho.edit - oh, I wood have put in a snappy pun but I am a am not a comedian so wood be barking up the wrong tree.

The one and only time I used OnStar emergency was when we were in traffic on 495, it was obvious the sports car in front of us had a driver falling asleep at the wheel. He kept drifting into lanes and then snapping back. The guy's head was lolling about, too. As we were reporting the make and license plate number, on the line with the operator, the car spun out, nearly hit a minivan, hit the embankment, and crashed into a grove of large trees on the side of the highway. I remembered thinking how... flimsy the car body looked. Like the guy probably hit the trees at about 20mph or less, and the hood just peeled off like it was paper. We couldn't stop, as we were in the middle lane. But we reported the wreck and the highway mile marker, and OnStar said police and ambulance had been dispatched.

I remember the first night I was in a new apartment in a ...marginal area of San Diego, I was awoken around midnight to the sound of a man centerpunching his Jeep Cherokee right in to the telephone pole in front of my door. By the time I threw on a t-shirt and went outside to check on the occupants, I saw the driver hauling ass on foot down into the nearby canyon. I don't know how fast he was going, but the front end was completely wrapped around the pole; it took the wrecking crew a long time to sawzall it free. You could see where his head hit the windshield on the inside, too. I was amazed the driver wasn't dead, much less able to run away the way he did.-----------I'm glad you were able to keep that kid off the road. It's a lucky thing no one was injured or killed.

I had a wreck like this in front of my house a few years ago. I was making coffee before work and wondered why the traffic was going so slowly by the house (usually, people rocket past, 20-30 miles over the speed limit). I look out the window and see a car parked across my second driveway, driver's door open, tail end sticking out into the road.I go outside and look. It was somewhat icy and the driver had lost control in front of my neighbor's house, skimmed through his drive, overcompensated, bounced off the hill across from my first driveway and came to rest in my second drive. At that point, the driver must have run away, leaving the car (still idling, with the keys in it).I called the cops and checked to make sure the guy wasn't in my back yard, under my porch or in my crawlspace. The staties got there and were... familiar with the car and the driver (which is probably why he ran in the first place).

The meth made him jittery, so the mj was to take the edge off. Guess it is time to update that old "never mix grape and grain" bromide.

I clearly remember when I walked over to him and ask if he was drunk he said "Do I look drunk?" and I said "No you look like you are tweaking".His response was "The cops are going to kill me"I took a good look at the tree he hit yesterday and I'm rather surprised it isn't damaged more. Then again, it is a nice younger oak tree about 14" across.

Then again, it is a nice younger oak tree about 14" across.Whenever we get road trauma in, we get a bit of history from the paramedics. Rough guide: a big hardwood tree is the second-worst thing to hit. The big root ball just holds it still and the car stops very quickly. Hitting a wall is substantially better for your health.The worst is a big animal like a cow, front or rear on. Spindly legs get snapped off and you get the heavy bit through the windscreen in the face. We got a guy in like that. We stopped resuscitation when the police officer turned up just afterwards with the poor punter's brain in a carrier bag."Don't think this is any use, doc. Before or after the accident!"Police - as sick as medical humour.

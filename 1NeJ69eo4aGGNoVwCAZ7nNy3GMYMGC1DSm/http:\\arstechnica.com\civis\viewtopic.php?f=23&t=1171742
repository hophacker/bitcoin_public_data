As some may know, I have 4 kids.One of which is a 14 year old boy.Today I was cleaning up random installs, and old crap on the hard-drive. As I was going through folders I found a nested folder, within a folder, within a folder where it should not have been.So clicking through the folders, I found a stash of about 20 interesting pictures of some tame to very hardcore porn.At first I was like....did I forget about a stash, so I went through, and decided nope. Not mine.Second off, I was like, hey. My son is straight. Thats good news.Third I was like wtf is my son hiding his porn on my computer. If Mrs Usku finds it I am one dead Usku.My initial thought was I better delete this and talk to the boy.But then I thought, wouldn't it be funny if I found 20 really hardcore gay porn pics, renamed the files and then deleted the stash? In a day or two I will check to see if the stash is still there, then talk to the boy about it.

*only* 20 pictures? Jesus. Back when I was 14 I not only BUILT MY OWN COMPUTER so that I could have my own porn stash, but we would trade floppy disks at school to expand our stash.Kids these days.I like the idea of changing it to churchlady. Then you crack churchlady jokes around him incessantly.

I like Church Lady, but would a 14 year old even know who that was these days? Is there an equivalent? Ned Flanders?

Then you crack churchlady jokes around him incessantly.Kinda sad that I was thinking the same thing. I only got caught because I was trying to print hard copy to keep in my room, I heard my dad come in, and turned the printer off. Well, when he went to go turn it on next time he needed it, guess what printed out...I was kinda lucky, my dad did something similar. He left the picture on my bed with a warning about if mom caught me. And a strange look. With good reason, mind you. I was all of 13, in the early '90s, and had already stumbled so deep into the 'net as to find furry porn.

I work in IT and in IT you clean up machines with massive malware infections and browser histories and commonly filled with some of the worst stuff you can think of. One time we were cleaning a guy's computer remotely and when we opened up Chrome it had a bunch of gay porn sites as the quick pages that you get when you open a new tab. We're in IT, we've seen everything and it doesn't bother us, but he immediately goes, that must be my son like he had never seen it before (because you know like every time you open your browser you couldn't miss it.) Dude threw his son right under the bus. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)

^^ The one I remember like that was I was cleaning out one of my company computers for a man that just retired. I found porn. Not just a little, a lot. However, the thing that stood out is that it was all old. As in, he retired at 65 in 2000, and this porn was obviously was from the '40s and '50s. He had held a candle for his youthful porn crushes all his life. It was kinda sweet in that "he's an old perv" kind of way. I was also impressed that someone, somewhere, had taken the effort to scan all that.

I think it's perfectly acceptable to be relieved that your child will be spared from it.

I fail to see how this is projection.Exactly. Meanwhile you post a rolleyes at the statement as if you can't understand or empathize with the position of wanting less bullshit for your own kid. "OMG, you must be anti-gay! Bad parent!" rolleyes, indeed.Quote:Your example is completely different, since homosexuality isn't a disability. It's like being unhappy to discover your child is black because racists exist. Actually, I would be unhappy if my child were born with some pigmentation anomaly that made her look black. Her life would be more difficult, and I kinda want my kid's life to be not-difficult. Seeing a child go through their teenage years without things that make them easy for cruel kids to single out is 'good'. Is that so hard to understand? I can honestly say that if my daughter were straight, that would be "good". Her life would be easier. If you have a problem with that, and you think that somehow makes me unhappy with my child, you are wrong. It's not some 'magical being a parent makes everything better canard' to roll your eyes at; it's human nature to want to protect your offspring.

Did you ever watch the Family Stone?Sara Jessica Parker(ol' horseface) took that (better not to be gay) position and got shat on. I am a parent, and our expectations shape our child's experience. Expecting your child not to be gay because it's easier is a failure, like expecting your kid to go on welfare because then he doesn't have to work. btmlltt

He later jokes about using gay porn as a weapon/prank. Then someone makes a joke about "it's not for me!" regarding the gay porn and he 'snickers'. There's a bit too much focus on homosexuality and "hurrr gay porn" for me to really believe the OP was merely saying "I guess it's good my child won't have to go through being picked on for being gay".Also, stop playing the "I bet you're not a parent" card, it makes you sound like jackasses. Read a little of STFU Parents to get a feel for how you (are/may be) being perceived. And, yeah, that scene in The Family Stone is desperately hard to watch, heh.

If nothing else, as a parent, having straight children is hardwired to be a positive, as it is a precursor for (except edge cases) biological grandchildren.However, this whole argument is Mind-Police territory. You can only ask people to do what's right, you can't control what they want. Unless you're multi-national conglomerates with an enormous advertising budget.

It's all moot, anyway, as his son's probably queerer than a three-dollar-bill: 1) When I first had access to porn, I looked at straight porn...and we all know how *that* turned out! I was too embarrassed/ashamed to look at what I *really* wanted to (at least right away).and/or2) After I figured out that, yes, my porn's gotta have dick in it, I kept some random straight porn in a 'hidden' folder, just in case someone went snooping they'd run in to it. I figured if they stumbled upon that, they'd think I was straight and wouldn't keep poking around - my *actual* stash was buried *much* deeper and much more obfuscated. Zipped in a password-protected ZIP file in a hidden directory many 'levels' deeper down and, even within that, I had changed all the file names and extentions. "hugeblackcockbukkake.jpg" became "win_bl_b.gpj" - I'd manually correct each extension when I wanted to look at a file, and then delete it or change it back when I was done. Pain in the ass (at least some of the videos looked like it! ), but I was paranoid. Happysin

Parents have the ability to look back at how they thought before they were parents and realize how naive they were. You don't have life experience as a parent to be able to fully understand. It's like me saying I understand how war changes people. I don't know shit. I've never fought in a war. I can read about it and talk to people to gain a rudimentary understanding, but I'll never fully understand. You know what else I don't completely understand as a parent on 9 year old twin boys? Raising girls or being a parent to teens. I haven't done that yet. As to the OP being relieved that his son isn't gay...I would be too. Not because I wouldn't love and completely support him. Because I know life is easier for straight people. Kids are mean to people who are different. Hell, adults are too. When that changes you can get all indignant about it.

Also - although I don't know why I'm being serious for a moment in the Lounge - I'm not going to join in any dog-pile on the OP. I think it's a pretty normal and understandable reaction (as unfortunate as that may or may not be). However, I would like to point out something to everyone 'defending' him:My mom basically professed the same type of thing after I came out (she'd suspected for quite a while): "I was fine with *you*, I was just worried about what you'd go through!"Let me tell you, kids pick up on fucking *every* thing - those type of words, as well meaning and perhaps even as true as they might be, do not help. She may have even believed it herself when she said them, but all I heard was a cover for a small core of what I felt she really thought. When all a kid wants to hear from you is, "You're gay, really?! That's awesome, honey! I'd always hoped but I wasn't sure! I love you so much! Hey, everyone - did you hear? I did get the gay son I'd always wanted - fucking RAD! " - anything short will probably feel like a knife in the gut...no matter how well-meaning.Anyway, just a cautionary tale to parents...even if the only thing behind "I hope my son isn't gay/I'm so relieived he's not..." is that wish that your kid has an easier life, your kid is likely only going to internalize the first part - "My parents don't want me to be who I am. " Even if it is never specifically verbalized, if your kid's in this situation, I guarantee they are watching you like a hawk for any little clue about your potential feelings on the matter - off-hand comments, reading your posts on a web forum, whatever. As far as having an easier life goes...in my case being gay itself was orders of magnitude easier to deal with than spending years 10-20 building up silent fear/shame/anger because you aren't 100% rock-solidly convinced that your parents *really* love you or will love you for 'you'.

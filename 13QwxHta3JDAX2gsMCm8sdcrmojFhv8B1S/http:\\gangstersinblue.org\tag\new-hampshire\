<p>Earlier this month, those who descended upon Manchester&#8217;s waterfront to view fireworks witnessed the last use of the Green Beam Laser in the &#8216;shire. The device wasn&#8217;t stolen by area gangsters (<a href="http://www.copblock.org/36256/manchester-pd-employees-target-free-speech-advise-person-threatened-to-let-the-judge-sort-it-out/" >though that was in the past threatened)</a>, but was sent to those active with the newly-formed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/194253417385193" >Dayton Cop Block</a>.</p>
<p>Bill D., the Manchester, &#8216;shire-based creator of the Green Beam Laser, which has been effectively used to warn travelers of nearby checkpoints and road pirate activity, posed this question, about the significance of July 04th:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What is Independence day? What does this celebration mean? Originally commemorating the revolutionary removal of a tyrannical government and the transition to a free nation. Today it seems more like a celebration of our current tyrannical government.</em></p>
<p>Much love to Bill D.! His entrepreneurship, technical know-how, and chill demeanor when out on the street, coupled with the documentation and dissemination of content, has been an awesome combination. Perhaps it&#8217;s not surprising then, that Bill is hard at work on the Green Beam Laser 2.0.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you appreciate Bill&#8217;s efforts help him make the Green Beam Laser 2.0 a reality.</strong></span></p>

<p>Bill told me recently that he&#8217;s only 700-FRNs shy of his goal for the new set-up.</p>
<p>Make that 650-FRNs as &#8211; taking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/comment?lc=gnOfqluqW5dg24gDY8b8bc4fU6MGE9R2m3IamhVKTmY" >a cue from Derrick J. Freeman</a> &#8211; I just donated 50-FRNs via Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>Date of Interaction</strong>: July 14, 2014<br />
<strong>Police Employees Involved</strong>: Wiggins, Sgt Mccutherson<br />
<strong>Police Employee Contact Information</strong>: 603-432-1118</p>
<p>At 10:20 AM, my wife and I were traveling through Londonderry, NH when a marked police SUV very quickly turned around and lit up the blues. He approached and didn&#8217;t ask politely for my wife&#8217;s license and registration, instead he stated, &#8220;Give me your license and registration now.&#8221; My wife told him it was a medical emergency, that we were in route to Parkland Medical Center in Derry because I was having severe chest pain. She even asked him to call an ambulance and he told her, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need no god damn ambulance. I stopped you because your car has the clear inspection sticker that is used in NH when your car passes safety but not emissions.&#8221; The clear sticker was just put on the car July 09, 2014, and with the clear sticker, you&#8217;re allowed 60 days to correct the issue. Again, my wife asked for him to call an ambulance. He said, &#8220;Shut up, it&#8217;s not happening.&#8221; Next, the sgt pulled up and saw my wife was recording the incident on her cell phone. The sgt took the cell phone and said it was evidence; he did not issue a receipt. The officer badge number #51 laughed and gave my wife a ticket for uninspected motor vehicle. She has never had a ticket in 20 years of driving.</p>
<p>After handing us the ticket, he stated, &#8220;Get out of my face, you CopBlockers make me want to puke.&#8221; (We have a CopBlock.org sticker on the rear bumper. I have been admitted to Parkland Medical Center with a minor heart attack and my wife got an illegal $62 ticket and a $500 phone stolen. She called and spoke with a male Lt. who refused to give his name and she could not even describe what happened before he hung up on her. She called back and supposedly he got a 911 call; this department is very rude and unprofessional, not to mention thieves and liars. I could have been having a massive heart attack and that officer refused to radio for an ambulance or even let my wife call for one, These police overpower situations need to stop. The police, especially Londonderry, NH Officer Wiggins badge #51, the Sgt, and Lt. should all be disciplined and or terminated from the job.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce a new relationship between Cop Block and Klassy Glass &#8211; a southern New Hampshire-based smoke shop, that now, in addition to beautiful glass, has <a href="http://copblock.org/store" >Cop Block t-shirts, stickers, lighters</a>, and a stack of the <a href="http://copblock.org/Flyers" > new 3&#8243; x 5&#8243; info flyer</a>.</p>
<p>I first met Ian, and others associated with Klassy Glass, when at <a href="http://porcfest.com" >PorcFest</a>, and after some conversations, we thought this arrangement to be a win-win.</p>
<p>Here is a bit from Ian on Klassy Glass, and our collaboration:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We started Klassy Glass because we recognized the void here in the Free State (NH) in regards to smoke shops. Instead of accepting the norm of price gouging, lack of quality, poor service, and no sense of locality, we decided to do our best to make a change.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We have always promoted to others to know their rights, and to always stand up for them! As time passed, we learned more about different groups that advocated personal liberty, like the <a href="http://freestateproject.com" >Free State Project</a>. Eventually, we were lead to the contributions of the group at <a href="http://copblock.org" >Cop Block</a>, and their <a href="http://copblock.org/groups" >many affiliates</a>. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Between seeing and experiencing stories of police abuse of power, hearing stories of &#8220;the state&#8221; from my mother (a local attorney), and now pushing a business in what many regard as a &#8216;grey&#8217; area, we thought, given the setting we are now in, what better way to support Cop Block and promote awareness and accountability than to feature them in Klassy Glass!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Stay Klassy. Stay Free. Stay Recording.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to Ian and the crew at Klassy Glass for their entrepreneurial efforts in creating a storefront and in sharing ideas believed sound!</p>

<p>When at PorcFest in Lancester, in the &#8216;shire, I ran into Mike, who&#8217;d just had a run-in with some folks who, despite claiming to protect and serve him, hindered his freedom of movement and now claim that he owes them money, or else.</p>
<p>Props to Mike for speaking out about the rights-violation he was subjected to &#8211; after all, he&#8217;d done nothing wrong. He&#8217;d not harmed another person or their property. There was no victim making claims against him. What there was though, was a thief (someone who subsists on wealth stolen from others), who proclaimed that the windows on Mike&#8217;s truck were <em>too </em>dark.</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>
<p>Would you feel safer living having to cross a checkpoint multiple times a week when going to work, or to the store, or to visit friends? Do you think it will be easier, and more effective, to speak out and take (non-initiatory of force) action against the bad ideas that support the police state apparatus today, or next year?</p>

<p><strong>Date of Interaction</strong>: August 2012<br />
<strong>Police Employees Involved</strong>: New Hampshire State Police</p>
<p>In August of 2012, I was stopped along Route 155 in Dover while bringing my girlfriend&#8217;s friend to the hospital because her nephew was being born. I was stopped for a temporary inspection sticker, which was not even expired. The officer first on scene told me why I was being pulled over, then asked me if there were any drugs, weapons, etc. in the car. It was eight in the morning, that would be the last thing I had in my car. She asked the two other passengers I had in my car for their IDs and then went back to her cruiser.</p>
<p>Upon arrival back at my car, she pulled my passengers and I out of the car and asked me if she could search it repeatedly. I denied, denied, denied. Then another cruiser pulled up. First, they told me they wouldn&#8217;t search it if they had a dog walk the perimeter and if he didn&#8217;t hit they would let me go on my way. I said, &#8220;Fine, if that&#8217;s what it takes to get me out of here, do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I agreed, they said a dog was not available right then. Then they both went on to tell me that if I did not consent to a search, they would impound my vehicle and they would search it then. Not knowing they could not do that to me, I agreed. I was told my car was clear and I could go freely on my way.</p>
<p>I shared my story to show that you have no rights with police if you do not know your rights. Today, I would&#8217;ve submitted complaints on both of these officers for infringing on my rights multiple times.</p>

<p>Police Employees Involved: Manchester, NH police department<br />
Police Employee Contact Information: Telephone: (603) 668-8711</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Manchester, NH police applied for and was granted an application slash warrant on May 5, 2014 from the Hillsborough County Superior Court Northern District in Manchester,NH to conduct a &#8220;sobriety checkpoint&#8221; at an undisclosed location in the county of Hillsborough, City of Manchester, State of NH on <strong>FRIDAY MAY 16, 2014</strong> and <strong>SATURDAY MAY 17</strong>, <strong>2014.</strong> Chief David Mara stated in his application to the superior court that his officers make several arrests of &#8220;impaired drivers&#8221; at every checkpoint that has been utilized in the city; he stated he is taking an aggressive stance on impaired drivers in his city, and that with each checkpoint, his officers are protecting all the residents of his city. In reality, the Manchester, NH police and the Hillsborough County Superior court are just abusing authority by holding these checkpoints while stomping on citizen&#8217;s rights and liberties. Chief mara stated in the application that at each checkpoint several arrests are made of impaired drivers; that alone is a completely false statement on part of Chief Mara. In 2013, at one of the checkpoints, they only made one single arrest of an impaired driver.</p>
<p>Again, the Manchester, NH Police and Hillsborough County Superior Court are going to be entrapping citizens for a so-called &#8220;sobriety checkpoint&#8221; at an undisclosed location in the city, so please, if you are out Friday May 16, 2014 and/or Saturday May 17, 2014, please use caution, as the Manchester Police will have the handcuffs and wagon ready to trap anyone possible.</p>
<p>On May 12, 2014, I called and spoke with the chief&#8217;s secretary and was told the checkpoint is in the best interest of the city and the people who live and visit Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: Manchester Police to stomp rights on May 16, 2014 (Friday) and May 17, 2014 (Saturday)</strong></p>

Police Employee Involved: Officer Salmon</p>
<p>I was stopped at roughly 9:30 AM traveling with my daughter through Tilton, NH. The cop approached my car and said, &#8220;License and registration.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Hey, how&#8217;s it going? Can I ask you why you stopped me?&#8221; He repeated, &#8220;License and registration.&#8221; I repeated, &#8220;Can I ask you why I&#8217;m being stopped?&#8221; He seemed to get agitated about my asking for a reason for the stop and so I told him I was going to start recording to keep everyone accountable, and that&#8217;s when the video starts. I was arrested and charged with &#8220;disobeying an officer.&#8221; The original stop, come to find out, was for an expired registration, which I was completely oblivious to.</p>

					<p><em>This post,  shared by <strong>Christopher Cantwell</strong>, was originally published at <a href="http://www.christophercantwell.com/2014/05/13/nh-cops-turn-argument-shootout-house-fire/" >ChristopherCantwell.com</a></em></p>
<h2>Brentwood, NH Police Officer Steve Arkell Dead After Turning Argument Into Shootout.</h2>
<p>Well, that escalated quickly. One police officer, and one &#8220;suspect&#8221; are dead after what began as a domestic argument Monday in a 55 and older community in Brentwood, NH, ended in a gun fight and exploding home.</p>
<p>86 year old Walter Nolan lived on Mill Pond road with his son Michael, <a href="http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/05/nh_neighbors_detail_chaos_at_fatal_cop_shooting_blast" >reports the Boston Herald</a>. They got into some kind of argument, some time around 4:00 PM. Rather than ask if everything was okay, a neighbor decided to call the most powerful gang in town, the Brentwood Police. Predictably, this did not improve matters any.</p>
<div id="attachment_4566" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.christophercantwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brentwood-NH-Officer-Steve-Arkell-Dead-After-Turning-Argument-Into-Shootout.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4566" src="http://www.christophercantwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brentwood-NH-Officer-Steve-Arkell-Dead-After-Turning-Argument-Into-Shootout-300x156.jpg" alt="Brentwood, NH Police Officer Steve Arkell Dead After Turning Argument Into Shootout" width="300" height="156" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brentwood, NH Police Officer Steve Arkell Dead After Turning Argument Into Shootout</p></div>
<p>Part-time Brentwood police officer Steve Arkell arrived on the scene shortly after, but apparently Michael Nolan didn&#8217;t want his &#8220;help.&#8221; Arkell, a 48 year old father of two, was shot to death as he entered the home, presumably without invitation. A second officer arrived on the scene, and also entered the home, but fled when he was met with what has been described as &#8220;rapid gun fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police flooded the scene, as an as of yet unknown cause started a fire inside the home, resulting in an explosion. The suspected shooter is believed to have died in the blaze. His father was taken to the hospital for as of yet unreported injuries.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about the summary of the available facts reported by the media so far, but allow me to speculate.</p>
<p>New Hampshire is a place with little gun control, and as a result, there is very little crime, at least in the private sector. As I read New Hampshire news, it seems like every time I hear about gun violence, the police are involved, and it usually involves them entering a home without the consent of the home owner.</p>
<div id="attachment_4570" style="width: 738px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sunsoflibertymint.com?solm=5" ><img class="wp-image-4570 size-full" src="http://www.christophercantwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/solmbanner.jpg" alt="Sponsored in part by Suns of Liberty Mint" width="728" height="90" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sponsored in part by Suns of Liberty Mint</p></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the Nolan family, but according to neighbors, they weren&#8217;t dangerous people. Susan Hughes told the Union Leader that Michael Nolan “never really talked to anybody; he stays upstairs with his TV on.” James Culbertson, 73, said the elder Nolan “seemed like a nice guy.” The Union Leader reported that Walter Nolan’s wife died two years ago, and Michael Nolan’s died of cancer in 2008.</p>
<p>So how do these seemingly normal people find themselves in a gun fight and exploding home? Obviously, it&#8217;s because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PT5ycft_YU" >the great escalators showed up</a>. Some busybody neighbor hears an &#8220;argument&#8221; and thinks this is a really great reason to dial 911, knowing that the most violent people around (the police) are going to show up. Said violent people show up, enter the house with a gun, without permission, and surprisingly enough, these folks who didn&#8217;t ask for help, aren&#8217;t so happy about this.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, maybe he&#8217;s irrational because he&#8217;s in a heated argument, maybe he genuinely doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a cop, maybe he&#8217;s rightfully fed up with police breaking into homes, the guy in the house opens fire on the cop, killing him. Once this happens, he knows his life is pretty much over. He knows that more police are going to come, and if he&#8217;s lucky enough to survive the ride to the jail, he&#8217;ll probably never leave. Faced with this horrific scenario, setting his home ablaze and taking his own life starts seeming like a reasonable alternative.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/crime/article/New-Hampshire-cop-dies-in-shooting-before-blaze-5473112.php" >Houston Chronicle</a>;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The entire State of New Hampshire is in mourning over the tragic loss of Brentwood Officer Steve Arkell,&#8221; Gov. Maggie Hassan said in a statement. &#8220;Officer Arkell bravely answered the call of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice, a heroic demonstration of his commitment to the safety of his fellow citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like so many of our first responders do on a daily basis, Officer Arkell courageously put his life on the line to protect others, and in doing so, was tragically taken far too soon,&#8221; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a New Hampshire resident, I couldn&#8217;t disagree more. I mourn the loss of Michael Nolan. I mourn the injuries of his father. I&#8217;m upset about the property damage. Not the loss of Officer Arkell&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Steve Arkell would be fine if he had taken a job as a construction worker, or a computer technician, or as a fast food cook. Instead, he decided to walk into a stranger&#8217;s home with a weapon, and turn a simple argument into a gun fight and exploding home. If Arkell had not shown up, this story would probably not even be worthy of news coverage, just another spat between two widowers in a retirement community.</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re thinking of calling 911 because your neighbors raise their voices, ask yourself if it&#8217;s worth all the death and destruction that so often follows these marauders around.</p>

<p><strong>Date of Interaction: May 7, 2014</strong><br />
<strong>Police Employee Involved: Jason Short</strong><br />
<strong>Police Employee Contact Information: jshort@ci.keene.nh.us 603.357.9813 x7122</strong></p>
<p>Sales associate Andrea doesn&#8217;t understand why this happened, because they “followed the law.” Masked men stole the products at the business under the guise of legality.</p>
<p>In a world where natural law prevails, these acts wouldn&#8217;t stand. Unfortunately, in this reality, men rule one another based on words written on paper, often performing immoral acts in the process. “Just doing my job,” is a common phrase said by those who are aggressors against their neighbors for harming no one. Agree with what Phat Stuff sells or not, it&#8217;s their natural right to be productive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited Phat Stuff a few times and witnessed first hand the talent involved in glass blowing. There is no telling how many thousands of man hours went into these artful pieces stolen by masked men and likely to be broken unintentionally or with malicious intent. If these individuals calling themselves DEA were proud of their actions, why don&#8217;t they dawn uniforms and uncover their faces?</p>
<p>Phat Stuff pays property taxes which pays the salaries of Keene PD and the Cheshire Sheriff&#8217;s Department for protection from theft. Surely these “protective” agencies knew this raid was coming.</p>
<p>The truth is, Phat Stuff doesn&#8217;t “pay” taxes. Nor do any of us. We are forced to under duress. If we voluntarily paid taxes, we could contact the “protective” agency of our choosing and would receive protection from theft. Instead, the entity calling itself the City of Keene sends Jason Short to guard the door and smile as his neighbors are stolen from. Shame on you Jason Short. Shame on all of you who participated in this theft directly or indirectly. Whether you like what Phat Stuff sells or not, this does not give you the right to take what isn&#8217;t yours.</p>

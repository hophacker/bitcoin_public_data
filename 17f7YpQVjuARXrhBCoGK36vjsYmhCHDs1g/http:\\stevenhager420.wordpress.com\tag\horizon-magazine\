		<p><a href="http://stevenhager420.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/thegang.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-768" title="thegang" src="http://stevenhager420.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/thegang.jpg?w=300&#038;h=135" alt="" width="300" height="135" /></a>While I was researching my hip hop book and film project, I got inspired to get involved in music again. I&#8217;d left that scene behind in 1967 after being kicked out of my Illinois garage band for taking LSD. In all fairness, the Knight Riders did offer me to rejoin a few days later, but the chemistry was already ruined.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I began interviewing all the kids in the South Bronx who created hip hop, that I got the urge to get back on stage. And at first, I edged into hip hop as a deejay, enlisting my two best friends, at the time, David Bither and Jeff Peisch, to join as my emcee group. Jeff rapped his own lyrics, while David blew wild sax solos, and I scratched up some break beat records Bambaataa had clued me onto. We held a performance at the cavernous apartment on the Upper West Side Jeff and I were living in. All three of us were rising freelance writers at the time, working for <em>Horizon</em> magazine, and other publications. Jeff and David got a cushy gig that summer with Lincoln Center. &#8220;High-level executive meeting&#8221; was Jeff&#8217;s code-phrase for smoking a joint during work. Our initial performance was attended by many critics and music-industry insiders, all of whom positively raved about how great we were. If nothing else, we certainly had attitude. Dave&#8217;s sax playing is what took it over the top since Jeff&#8217;s rapping style was more of a white-boy parody of real rap, talking about his Sony color TV set and Klipsch speakers, and other toys he coveted. We probably could have become something, but I had also been moving in circles around the East Village, writing for the<em> Soho News</em> and <em>East Village Eye</em>,  and soon discovered garage bands were very much in fashion downtown. Laurie Lennard was going out with Jeff at the time, and was one of the top goddesses on our scene, a real go-getter who eventually landed a job booking talent for David Letterman. Laurie would later become famous for marrying Larry David and producing &#8220;An Inconvenient Truth&#8221; with Al Gore. According to Jeff, her body was an exact replica of Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s. That&#8217;s her in the red sweater with her arm around me in the above photo. Jeff would soon become news director of the newly-created MTV, and then an award-winning producer for Time/Life, while David eventually landed his dream job co-running Nonesuch Records.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a rocker at heart. So I switched gears and told my friends to come to a rehearsal for a garage band I was going to start. I had two cardboard boxes set-up in my bedroom and a pair of drumsticks. That was going to be my instrument to get started. I tried to enlist Dave to play organ, as he knew music theory, could write songs, and sang like a bird. But Dave would only come to the rehearsal <em>if</em> he could play lead guitar. He&#8217;d already been in a few bands as a keyboardist and wanted to make the switch. Flick Ford, my favorite art director at the <em>Eye</em>, was a natural choice as a lead singer. He had a dynamic energy that could bowl you over when he was on. But I didn&#8217;t know if Flick could sing, so I also invited Rick Dehaan to show up because he had a great rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll look and had recently tried to commit suicide. I thought this project might pick up his spirits. Rick&#8217;s psychiatrist asked him what concrete steps he was taking to make improvements in his life, and Rick replied: &#8220;I&#8217;m playing the lottery.&#8221; &#8220;But that&#8217;s not very concrete, is it?&#8221; replied the psychiatrist. The next day Rick won a million dollars. At that point I was probably thinking we could use Rick to buy equipment. Brian Spaeth helped me conceive the whole project. Brian had been through a similar experience as me, having been unceremoniously booted out of the Fleshtones, the reigning gods of garage rock in New York. The only band that could touch the Fleshtones at the time was probably the Lyres out of Boston. I met Brian when I began working at <em>High Times</em> as Executive Editor. It was a relief to finally land a weekly paycheck after being a freelancer for months. Anyway, I told Dave I&#8217;d already promised lead guitar to Bob Brandel, one of the best guitar players from the garage scene in Illinois, who was now working for NBC news as an art director. So that became the core of the band, which I soon named &#8220;The Soul Assassins:&#8221; Brian on bass, me on cardboard boxes, Bob on guitar and Flick singing. We knew right away we were onto something. Brian didn&#8217;t like the idea of two lead singers at first, but I told him the lead singer&#8217;s ego was always the biggest issue in any band and that if we had two, it would help keep their egos in check. Rick never had an ego, but Flick soon developed a whopper. But then so did I, I suppose. (I guess the funniest confrontation was the night Flick got drunk and said, &#8220;I am the head dick in the band.&#8221; To which I replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s right, Flick.&#8221; We were both pissing on the roof at Dino&#8217;s on Sixth Street.) I soon pulled in Brian Morse, who had drummed briefly for the Finchley Boys back in Illinois, which allowed me to switch to rhythm guitar. Our first gig was a High Times Christmas party, and the film director John McNaughton (a grade-school friend of Bob&#8217;s) flew in for the party and played organ on a couple of songs. You can listen free to the band, and download songs for 99 cents by clicking the Soul Assassin link in the middle of the links at the top-right of this page.</p>

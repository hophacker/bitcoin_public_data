		<p><em></em><a href="http://stevenhager420.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-4.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1200" title="Picture 4" src="http://stevenhager420.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-4.png?w=187&#038;h=300" alt=""   /></a><em>The Risk of Being Ridiculous</em> by Guy Maynard got me interested in blogging about the 1960s. Maynard grew up in Urbana, Illinois, a year ahead of me, and was one of the leading figures in the garage-band movement that started around 1966. His book takes place in 1969 and really captures the intensity of the times. I gave it a rave review in High Times and it inspired me to dig up my own archives from the 1960s, especially a short story I wrote called &#8220;The Steam Tunnels.&#8221; I was surprised at how well my story had held up over the years. I&#8217;d forgotten most of the trauma I went through in the mid-&#8217;60s. People called it a &#8220;Generation Gap&#8221; but it was really a &#8220;Generation War.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s another novelist from my home town who wrote extensively about Carpenter and Cole, who (along with Guy and George Faber) had led the garage-rock movement in Central Illinois. Mandy Moores was actually one of my sister&#8217;s best friends in high school, and she ended up briefly married to Carp, and lived with him down in New Orleans when he and Cole were both deep-sea diving off oil platforms around the world. It was incredibly dangerous work, although the pay was pretty good.</p>
<p>Mandy&#8217;s book, <em>Dream Palace</em>, came out many years ago, but I just got around to reading it recently. Mandy&#8217;s brother, Brian, was the original drummer for my band, the Soul Assassins, as well as one of the drummers for a later incarnation of The Finchley Boys, the greatest garage band to emerge from Central Illinois. I&#8217;ve lost touch with both Brian and Mandy, so maybe this blog will bring them back into my orbits.</p>
<p>You can pick up a copy of <em>Dream Palace</em> for around a buck on Amazon. I kinda wish I could have helped Mandy edit this project, because she&#8217;s clearly a very talented writer. This first novel could have been something spectacular, on a similar level as Maynard&#8217;s book, but it has some flaws. For one, Mandy was a little too close to the subject when she wrote this, and had a lot of issues she was working out. Carp had a well-known anger-management problem, and we all knew you didn&#8217;t push his buttons unless you were looking for serious trouble. But Carp could also be a heroic figure, and this side of him is mostly missing. I also would have loved to have gotten more details on his garage band origins in Urbana, as well as more details on the dangers of deep-sea diving. For example, When Doug Blair got beat-up for making fun of the football coach (Smitty),  it was Carp who went after Frank Sowers to take revenge. Reading the book, I couldn&#8217;t believe how tough Mandy was, pushing Carp&#8217;s buttons big-time, forcing confrontations with him, and basically not taking any shit at all. Unfortunately, their marriage was doomed because they were headed in completely different directions. Mandy had a fairy-tale view on life when in high school. I remember her many paintings that evoked this magical dream life. The book does a good job of capturing this side of her personality, but her fairy tale turned bad when Carp started getting violent.</p>
<p>Bugsy&#8217;s not in the book far as I could tell, although he was also part of that New Orleans crew, working as a deep sea diver. Carp always had some major schemes going on. Mandy goes into great detail on his 50-foot sailboat that he overhauled and eventually took to Jamaica for a load of pot. Unfortunately, this trip coincided with an anti-smuggling campaign supervised by then-Vice President George Bush. On their way back to the Florida Keys with a boatload of ganja, Carp and Bugsy were unexpectedly intercepted by a fleet of warships that had been deployed to root out drug smugglers. With the Coast Guard bearing down on him, Carp went into action-mode, and tried to dump all the bales before they were intercepted. Unfortunately, he wasn&#8217;t fast enough and the Coast Guard was able to pull a bunch of the bales out of the water.</p>
<p>In a most amazing coincidence, the head prosecutor in Florida handling their case was none other than Ralph Hersey, who&#8217;d been a columnist for my underground paper, <em>The Tin Whistle</em>. I tried to recruit all the best writers in my high school and Ralph had been suggested by one of the English teachers. Ralph was a good counterpoint to Charlie Geron. They were both black, but Charlie was angry and confrontational, while Ralph was the model of common sense and morality. We also had a great poet in our class, Jim Guthrie, and I remember going to Jim&#8217;s house and trying to recruit him. Jim took one look at the first issue of <em>The Tin Whistle</em>, however, and decided it wasn&#8217;t for him. His work was considerably more mature than what most of us were doing at the time and Jim would go on to win many poetry awards in the 1970s.</p>

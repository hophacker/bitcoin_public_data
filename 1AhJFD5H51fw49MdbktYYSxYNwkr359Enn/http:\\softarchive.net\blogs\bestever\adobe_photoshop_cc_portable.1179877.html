The screen is 1024 x 768 (1280 x 800) with 16-bit video card and 512 MB of video memory (support for 3D-components requires 1 GB of video memory)<br>
System with support for OpenGL 2.0<br><b><br>
Note:</b><br>
Select interface language to run the portable building will be in the file ChooseLang.ini near PhotoshopCCPortable.exe<br>
Accelerate launch! In the folder ".. PhotoshopAppPsResources" are some of the resources of the program that you will be able to manipulate (ie, disconnect and connect them as needed). There is the ability to edit video files. To turn off the video editing (if you do not use it and want to accelerate the launch of the program) - dynamiclink delete folders and folders of dynamiclinkmediaserver ".. PhotoshopAppPsResources" or (if you want to turn off only for a while), rename it to "-dynamiclink" and "-dynamiclinkmediaserver" and to enable the reverse steps.<br>
Up module Camera Raw 8.0.0.137, but no lens profiles. To add profiles lenses Camera Raw and Lens Correction unzip ".. PhotoshopAppPsResourcesCameraRaw" (originally a portable building is just a blank template). If you want to be for some time to disable Camera Profiles and Lens Profiles (to the same and run the program to accelerate), then remove them is not necessary: &#8203;&#8203;just place at the beginning of the folder name CameraRaw "-" sign or the other (example: "-CameraRaw "), and to enable the reverse steps.<br>
And finally, a word of advice: when you close it, especially if you are working from a flash drive, wait a few seconds before restarting (or before removing the USB-device), as the program needs some time to move from a system and registry in your folder the updates and remove the traces<br><br><div class="center"><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://imgarchive.info/viewpicture.php?file=1137694.jpg&amp;amp;amp;th=" target="_blank"><img src="http://imgarchive.info/201109/1137694.jpg"></a></div><br><blockquote><div style="background:#fff"><div style="width: 25%;background:url(/templates/imgs/icon_plus.gif) no-repeat scroll 10px 8px transparent;background-position:5% 50%;cursor:pointer;background-color:#eeeff0;border-left:4px solid #747474;border-bottom:0;display:block;position:relative;z-index:1;color:#FFF;padding:10px 30px;" onclick="spoiler(this);"><span style="font: 15px/118%; color: #0c6db1;"><u>Download from Rapidgator.net</u></span></div><div class="spoiler_3"><br><a href="http://rapidgator.net/file/5ef1b844039723c78fe3e42eec61af07/Ad0be_Ph0t0sh0p_CC_14.0_Portable_softarchive.net.rar.html" rel="external nofollow" class="auto_link" target="_blank">http://rapidgator.net/file/5ef1b844039723c78fe3e42eec61af07/Ad0be_Ph0t0sh0p_CC_14.0_Portable_softarchive.net.rar.html</a><br></div></div><br><div style="background:#fff"><div style="width: 25%;background:url(/templates/imgs/icon_plus.gif) no-repeat scroll 10px 8px transparent;background-position:5% 50%;cursor:pointer;background-color:#eeeff0;border-left:4px solid #747474;border-bottom:0;display:block;position:relative;z-index:1;color:#FFF;padding:10px 30px;" onclick="spoiler(this);"><span style="font: 15px/118%; color: #0c6db1;"><u>Download from Uploaded.net</u></span></div><div class="spoiler_3"><br><a href="http://ul.to/kbziqc3g" rel="external nofollow" class="auto_link" target="_blank">http://ul.to/kbziqc3g</a><br></div></div><br><div style="background:#fff"><div style="width: 25%;background:url(/templates/imgs/icon_plus.gif) no-repeat scroll 10px 8px transparent;background-position:5% 50%;cursor:pointer;background-color:#eeeff0;border-left:4px solid #747474;border-bottom:0;display:block;position:relative;z-index:1;color:#FFF;padding:10px 30px;" onclick="spoiler(this);"><span style="font: 15px/118%; color: #0c6db1;"><u>Download from Letitbit.net</u></span></div><div class="spoiler_3"><br><a href="http://letitbit.net/download/09021.083c5874c45b33b5b69cfb2019de/Ad0be_Ph0t0sh0p_CC_14.0_Portable_softarchive.net.rar.html" rel="external nofollow" class="auto_link" target="_blank">http://letitbit.net/download/09021.083c5874c45b33b5b69cfb2019de/Ad0be_Ph0t0sh0p_CC_14.0_Portable_softarchive.net.rar.html</a><br></div></div></blockquote><br><br>								<div class="advertising_item_news_full" id="download_fast" data-src="http://softarchive.net/adv/getBanner.php?id=16"></div>
